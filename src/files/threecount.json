The inside is super dingy deli/convenience store, so I was excited for a real, down and dirty deli sandwich. They have a lot of weird items in their grocery section which can be kind of fun to look through.\n\nI got an Italian \"hoagie\" as I feel is the appropriate term for this ultra-Pittsburgh spot. It was bad. Totally skimpy on the meat, and it had American cheese and mayo, which don't go well with Italian meats at all...provolone and oil \u0026 vinegar would have made way more sense. The bread was a squishy white bun. I mean, I still ate it, but I didn't really enjoy it. It made me kind of sad. It was just a sad, floppy excuse for a sandwich. At least it was cheap?\n\nMaybe I should have gotten the chipped ham instead, since that's what they are famous for.

We started off w/ house potato chips (my friend had never had these at any restaurant. That, I thought, was odd). The chips came with blue cheese and some blue cheese sauce, with scallions liberaly placed throughout. They were awesome, the perfect munchy to start off lunch. We both ordered salads for the main course; I got the Oriental chopped salad and my pal got the grilled chicken house salad. Both were typical salads, but the portions were huge. The dressing on mine was particularly yummy, and the Asian noodles were a nice crunch between the lettuce.\n\nThe slow service moment happened during our checkout--we tried to get our bill for at least 20 minutes before we saw our server. Even when she split the check up, she split the meals wrong and I ended up paying for my friend's potato-cheddar soup (v. good, btw). Oh well.

All varieties of tortillas (corn and flour), freshly made of high quality ingredients, plus supplies for tamales, tortillas chips of a variety of colors, and even an assortment of pan dulce. While I was there I was invited by the very friendly Plant Manager, Jasmin Garcia, into her office to see some of her new product offerings. They have an impressive line of offerings, including tostada shells of various colors. I left with a handful of tasty blue corn tortillas, healthy but very tasty whole wheat tortillas, and a batch of awesome tasting red child whole wheat flour burrito-sized tortillas that my coworkers devoured when we tried them at lunch in the office.

All were pretty much as expected.  \n\nWe chose the non-spicy Naeng Myun, which is a giant bowl of chewy buckwheat noodles in an iced tangy beef broth with julienned veg and slices of Korean pear (the spicy version comes without soup).  We were first introduced to this dish at Hodori in LA's K-town by a Korean friend and ever since we've been hooked.

When I pulled up to the window I was greeted by 2 different people which is rare, sometimes at fast food joints you can barely get a total out of the person at the window. I watched how they were operating as a team and having worked in fast food before, I found it to be a well oiled machine. When you're scored on every second of a transaction, that counts.

Like a generic pizza..Possible imitation cheese, pepperonis, sauce and dough. I sprinkled copious amounts of garlic salt/powder and crushed red peppers all over it to give it some flavor.

JETTA, a glamazon in her early twenties, stares longingly into the night. An alluring ingenue with a dark and questionable past, she shivers in 90 degree night, tears forming in her eyes. Behind her is PIZZA PATRON, a tall, fedora-wearing gentleman. He sports a mustache that doesn't play by the rules. JETTA knows he is behind her.)\n\nJETTA\nI'm sorry. I just can't.\n\nPIZZA PATRON\nWhy can't you let me love you, Jetta?\n\nJETTA\nBecause there's nothing left of me to love. I've been burned before. Lured by promises of reasonably priced large one-toppings and hearty, flavorful hot wings. Only to be given hot plates of garbage and crunchy and disturbingly misshapen wings of what I can imagine were once, long before growth hormones, in fact chickens. I don't known if I can trust you.\n\nPIZZA PATRON\nBut I'm not like the others.\n\nJETTA\nThey all say that. I like you, PP. I like your logo depicting a Federale whose about to cut me open and empty my stomach of all that cocaine I spent all morning stuffing in. I like how you scream \"PIZZA PATRON!\" at the top of your lungs to me whenever I step in the store. I like your queso sticks and chorizo-topped pizza. I even like how you accept pesos in lieu of dollars, no matter how many shithead right-wingers boycott and protest your storefront. Don't you see? I like you. If I open my heart to you, I could risk hating you. Can't we just settle for \"like\"?\n\nPIZZA PATRON\nWhat would be the point? Why offer a 4.99 large one-topping if the box isn't going to litter your living room floor. Why offer lime and pepper-flavored chicken wings if I can't know that somewhere, it's you're lips sucking the meat off the bone? Don't you see, Jetta? Without you taking advantage of my ridiculously underpriced food, there'd be no reason to make it in the first place. I don't know how else to say this--\n\nJETTA\nShhh. You had me at \"$4.99 one topping\". \n\n(The two embrace. Music plays dramatically in the background.)\n\nSomebody put a stop to me. Please."]}

The crust was all right but how do you screw up a thin-crust? Let's not hold them to that though...\n\nThe cheesy bread was cheesy, crappy, and salty all rolled into one. \n\nThe chicken wings were not as cooked as I would have liked which made it even more gross.  There was a lot of skin on them. GROSS GROSS GROSS!!!  I am not sure what kind of sauce they put on it but it looked like watered down ketchup and it just looked plain nasty. It did not look appetizing at all! On a normal day I can throw down a double order of wings with no problem but with this I only ate 2 pieces and said to myself \"what a waste of money.\" \n\nThe chocolate crunchy thing tasted okay but it was very sweet.

We also got an order of cheese bread sticks and some of there boneless chicken kicker things. \n\nThe chicken kickers were tasty.

My meal also came with cinna-sticks. When the food arrived, instead of cheese sticks, I got bread sticks, with a heavy sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar. I called the location, and after being transferred 3 times, and 2 reps basically telling me I didn't exist as a customer because my order had been delivered, so I wasn't in the system, I got to speak with a manager. The manager offered to have someone come back out and bring the cheese sticks. So, I agreed. 15 minutes later, an unhappy looking delivery girl shows up, shoves a bag of bread in my face, and says, \"here\", and walks away. No apology, no have a good day, nothing. And do you know what she brought? BREAD STICKS! Not cheese sticks that I paid for, and waited extra for, but bland and unflavored carb sticks! \n\nSorry Pizza Hut, but I'm done with you.

In general I don't have problems with my experiences in places like this.  And even what I do I don't worry about it because I know exactly what I am getting.

My card is perfectly good but she couldn't get it to run.\n\nB)  She DEMANDED, and I mean DEMANDED another form of payment.  Well, I refused, because that card is perfectly good and if she knew how to use the credit card machine she would know that if you go a little slower it works just fine.  In fact, the card was used several times earlier in the day at several other places.  Being rude and demanding another forum of payment is already bad but you have no excuse to be at a window and not know how to use the credit card machine!\n\nC)  At this point I was annoyed, but she continued to push me by telling me just how her credit card machine works (by the way I am a software engineer and have worked on PoS systems and she ha no earthly clue what she is talking about, but I digress).  When I said to her, frankly at this point, and I quote, \"It doesn't matter now.  The point is moot since you got the card to run.\"  She then proceeded to stand at the window and say things like \"Wow.\" in rude tunes.  I said to her several times, in a monotone voice, \"Lady, I just want my food.  Can I go please?\"  She wouldn't stop.  Kept on keeping on in a test of wills with me.  She was way cooler then me man, working at a BK in what is probably her mid 30's.  I was doing jobs like this at 16.  Your parents must think you are the envy of the whole family with all of your success.\n\nD)  Finally when she did hand me the food, she said in as smug a voice as she could muster, \"Here's your food, dude.\"  At that point I yelled back \"LATERS!\" as loud as I could hoping everyone inside would now know what an idiot this woman is.\n\nE)  The fries were cold.  And she was so busy trying to how just how awesome and cool she is, she forgot the damn Sweet and Sour sauce that was supposed to go with my kids' meals.\n\nIn short, TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!!!!!!!!!  I really blame management for this.  Managers, pay attention!  LEARN TO TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND HOW TO USE THE STUPID CREDIT CARD MACHINE AND KNOW NOT TO CONTINUE OPENING YOUR MOUTH AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES TO STOP!

Either pack them fuller or roll them tighter, damn!\nThat said, it has no real minuses that every other taco shop in the Valley doesn't have, thus the average rating.  It primarily stands out for me because it's 24-7 and a close proximity to my house, which is to say that if you have an average taqueria that fits your hours and location already there's probably not a big reason to make a trip for this one.\nFinally, if I do go back (a certain eventuality) I will probably not be getting the fish burrito.

An excellent west side stop, especially if you work over there. Definitely a fun place to be a regular. Typical bar fare, but not too shabby.","The Old Town Pub has been a fairly consistent option for a beer and a sandwich when you find yourself on the west side beyond West Towne Mall.  Over the years I've been to the OTP numerous times, mainly because I found myself in the area and could think of nowhere else.  The bar is tucked away in a strip mall across from Woodman's.  There is very little else in the area and the OTP kind of comes off like a place that has never really worried about competition.  The overall feel of the place skews toward the regulars parked at the bar, but it never seems too unfriendly, just a bit insular.  There is a element of west side townie to be found on the weekends too.  This can lead to the usual aggravations like waiting at the bar for a drink while the bartender serves up all the people he knows, or the waitress engaging in long conversations with the tables around you when you desperately desire another beer.  Conversely these type of things must seem warm and welcoming if you happen to be a regular, which explains why there are so many of them here.\n\nThe food at the Old Town Pub is fairly standard bar food.  My father used to swear the chili here was the best in town, but I think the recipe was changed a few years back.  Don't get me wrong, the chili's still quite good but I believe they switched from shredded to ground beef and he says it's just not the same.  I've had a few decent sandwiches here over the years and everything is usually pretty good, but I stopped getting burgers because they never seemed to come out as ordered - either too well done or not enough.  The last few times I've been I've gotten the chicken wrap with the fries, which is perfect with a couple of bottles of Capital Amber.  I recall that when I first started coming here with my parents in the mid-90's the \"house beer\" was New Glarus Edel Pils, which was impressive since most places didn't carry micro taps back then.  I don't believe they still have this on tap, and I've had a few unpleasant experiences courtesy of unclean lines so I generally stick to bottles.  The tap selection isn't that impressive by today's standards but it is serviceable.\n\nThere is a nice set up of boothes along the back wall that gives you a little more privacy than the regular tables closer to the bar.  There's several flat screens throughout the OTP and the last time I was there it appeared that they have the MLB package.  I even didn't get any dirty looks cheering for the Cubs during the last series with the Brewers.  The weekday lunch and dinner crowds seem to be a bit more laid back than the weekend set, and the fryers are usually on pretty late into the night for appetizers.  The Old Town Pub is not usually the kind of place you actively seek out unless you're a regular, but I'm happy it is there.  Plus, the murals in the mens' room are worth a visit by themselves."]}

The garlic bread appetizer is awesome.  The half-size portion is gigantic (at least for two), giving you plenty to chew on.  In fact, this plus a salad each is probably enough for most people to eat.  You could get this and not have to order anything else - but the rest of the food is good, you'll likely want to do so!\n\nLike the garlic bread, the calzone is monstrous.  This thing was about the size of my head.  Even without the garlic bread and a salad, I'm not sure I could have finished it.  As it was, I only had perhaps half of it.  My wife had an eggplant parmesan plate that was similarly portioned, but there really wasn't any comparison.  For the price, go with the calzone - easily the best portion for price on the menu.\n\nThe service here is good, but not great - one of the detractors to the place.  Even outside of busy hours, the staff is cordial, but not overly friendly.  They hustle you along, which isn't bad, but they don't dawdle at your table by any means.  I typically like to get a recommendation from the staff on what is good, that's not something they like to share.  Only when we were getting near to the end of our meal were the staff friendly - almost like they were glad that people were leaving.  Just sent the wrong message."]}

So if you're meeting a friend there, it's Sushi Moto (so's you don't get lost)......if you get a frequent eater card after you dine there a couple times it's Sushi Khan as it says on the card and menu.\n\nThat being said......this is by far the best place to go for \"ALL YOU CAN EAT\" sushi.  Some places get skimpy and serve you smaller portions.  Or give you a time limit and take their time making your fish.  But here, it's Fantasy Roll time,  or Royal Flush Roll, or Rainbow Roll...or whatever roll you happen to wish for or see on the menu.  They'll even make you a nice plate of Tuna Poki as part of the all you can eat.

The bad part is that I don't remember \"Kitchen Boy's\" real name, so the last time I was there I called him that......I thought I was gonna end up in a hand roll.

As it is now, you can just walk in.\n\nGreat place to bring a date - low lighting, great service, great food, lots of fun.","Ippei is the best Sushi place I have found in Arizona.  The cucumber mint martini has me coming back, time and time again!  The sashimi is outstanding and the sushi chefs have some very creative rolls which I have never tried (Blackjack \u0026 Southwest roll).  The dinner menu is much more extensive, and I suggest first-time dinners to come by for dinner. The owner, Michael, is very nice.  When he recognizes you as a regular you will typically end up with something special from the kitchen (his treat).  It is important to mention that Ippei offers an extensive non-fish menu too, which allows you to bring sushi lovers and non-sushi eaters alike to this great establishment.  Do not miss the pot-stickers.  A note on decor: Ippei has a very welcoming modern interior making it an excellent environment to unwind or bring a client."]}

It is close by and located in a dirty strip mall between a rib shack and a Dollar store and the parking area is shared with a Food City (closed now) and a Chinese food restaurant. Needless to say parking is at a premium especially evenings and Friday nights. I only go there when I don't feel like cooking dinner or there is nothing in the frig.

Unlike most of the customers, I am about 6ft. tall and have a good vantage point. If you want to eat your pizza don't look. Just put your blinds on and leave quickly. Hopefully your car is still there. But if you decide to look you will notice food prep without gloves, no hair nets, cashiers handling food after handling money, staff eating while working, half eaten pizzas on working surfaces, phone orders being taken while eating or boxing up your order, flies in the window dead and alive, walls and floors thick with grime, kitchen area and equipment filthy with old grease, workers unkempt, dirty and disheveled looking. Pretty sad, to say the least, but surprisingly I have never gotten \"physically\" ill ( I think I have built up a tolerance/ immunity or lucky) and the pizzas taste pretty darn good and hot. They have never messed up my order either. AMAZING!! If you do decide to go...enter at your own risk.  I will probably go there again and push my luck. I just wish they would clean up their act!!!

On being delivered my sandwich, I unwrapped and lifted the top bun.  Plenty of pickle and onion and a burger that is seriously hot.  In asking the drive-thru person where the tomato is, she told me it was under the burger.  Putting the top bun back on and flipping it over, there is no tomato under the meat.\n\nShe apologized and walked to the grill area.  Once there, she picked up 2 slices of tomato and brought them to the window.  She had not put on gloves, she had not washed her hands and she offered me the tomato slices.  \"Honey, your hands have been on the register and taking money from people.  I'm not going to take any unwrapped food item from you.\"  I asked for a refund of the 30 cents.  While she processed the refund, I wrapped the burger up.  She handed me change and I headed home.\n\nOn arriving home, I ate and called the Jack line, I was advised this location is a franchise-owned store.

The inside has a nice homey feel with booths that have extra throw pillows (love that) and soft lighting and desert scape paintings.  A big drawback is that while half of the seats face the lovely paintings the other half face the kitchen.  \n\nThe wine flights are good but the pours are inconsistent and not as hearty as in some places.  The bulk of their wine menu comes in bottle form.  They do offer 8 oz pours of wine for about $15 a glass.  Be careful when you order, as we were given 8oz pours and had no idea we were getting them.  \n\nThe food was quite good, they actually had real grilled focaccia and this garlic cream butter that was delicious.

When Bonnie and I were debating the look and decor of the place we decided on Levitz or Mor Furniture for Less.  Think boring Southwestern chaise test patterns for seating and stylized Sedona landscape paintings for art. Ick!  An article in the Arizona Republic even said the owners were puzzled as to why they kept getting the Wisconsin 40-something crowd - and well they should wonder no further. \n\nOther than that I really enjoyed my wine - rieslings and a sauvignon blanc, noshed on marinated olives and mixed nuts and enjoyed the company of random Yelpers. Our server was pretty attentive and checked up on us often and with each new person who arrived. \n\nIf you're not too concerned with the generic suburban atmosphere you might like this wine bar.

The menu is written on the window in paint and its very old school. WE LOVED IT! The food was home made and the ribs were smoked so well. The weird smoker thing is hauled around town, and we actually saw them again at Goldfield days in Goldfield NV not long after eating at their \"restaurant\". DO NOT MISS THE PEACH COBBLER! These are recipes haded down from generation to generation. I can not belive this place hasn't been on Drive In's, Diners, and Dives, it is a GEM!  I am giving it only 4 stars because of the poor seating, otherwise it would get 5. The neighborhood seems a bit sketchy so this would be a good daytime visit.","I need to praface this post with a little background on myself.  I grew up in Texas and am a huge BBQ fan.  Ever since moving to Vegas, I have struggled to find BBQ€ that satisfied my palate.  My favorite so far is the chain Lucille's located in the District in Green Valley (near me).  Few things beat going with a bunchof friends and getting the Backyard Feast.  It's about a $100, but can feed 4-6 and is a ton of high quality food. Although very tasty, the price point prevents me from going there daily. However, H and H is the kind of place I could easily go to fairly often thanks to its low prices and tasty food, but the distance is prohibitive for me. On to the review:\n\nSo, I originally tasted H and H's food at the taste of Las Vegas. They had a booth there and were serving some tasty rib tips. I subconciously said I would scout out this place and frequent them, but after learning they were in N. Las Vegas, I kind of put them out of mind.\n\nThat was until I happened to be nearby and found it.  It's across from the N Las Vegas City Hall in the Food 4 Less shopping center.  It's a shack.  Tehre's no other way around it.  You can either park and go to the pick up window to order or drive thru (although there is no menu nor a speaker system so you are literally driving up to a different pick up menu).  For speed's sake, I suggest parking your car and ordering at the window or phoning in your order to really save time as efficiency is not H and H's strong suit, food is.\n\nWhen going there, winners are the smothered specials with 2 sides and a bread ($5 for chicken and $6 for pork chop) and any of the meat combos (rib tips, pulled pork, etc) (something like $5-$9 depending on which meat and small or large)  Tasty stuff!\n\nThey also do a lot of fried fish that the charge by the pound (~$6.50/POUND).  The sides were typical of a soul food restaurant (black eyed peas, greens, mac and cheese, etc).  they were all fine, but the meat is the real star of the show.  I'm tempted to try their banana pudding, cobblers, sweet tea, and kool aid the next time I go back.  If only it wasn't so dang far.\n\nAll in all, this place is CHEAP and TASTY. Note, there are no tables and chairs. This is LITERALLY a shack. They even bar b q in the parking lot. Mind you, that's the tastiest parking lot food I've ever had.\nGO WHEN IT'S DAYLIGHT"]}

Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.\n\nSave yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.

I would say the freshness and taste of the salad was more appealing than the pizza.  Although the pizza is definitely tasty and fresh too, it's just not what I am into as it had a cornmeal type thick crust. Call me low class in the pizza category, but I am a big fan of Domino's thin crust.  For fancy pizzas, I love Stratta at the Wynn. However, I don't like deep dish or thick crust which is why I am not the hugest fan of the pizza here.  So, if you like something with a thicker crust, this could be your place. It's nothing against the, it's just the style they do.\n\nAlso, the decoration is charming and it's clean.

Get the full menu... for only an additional $8, you can have a choice of entree (meaning appetizer) and dessert added to the main course of your choice's price.  My favorite was my daughter's duck done two ways.  My son also had an amazing ravioli with duck confit.  I started with the snails (perfect texture, neither chewy nor mushy) and had the mixed grill, which was also delicious and perfectly cooked.  My husband had a salad with gizzards, which doesn't sound like something you want, but believe me, it really is.  Desserts were also impressive.  The wine list, not available on the website, is on a chalkboard in the restaurant.  Most bottles are in the $35-55 range, with many glasses available from $7.5-9.\n\nThere was one cheerful waiter (he's actually from France) serving the whole place and making it look easy and fun.  And I think the chef/owner cooks everything himself.

The ambiance is great - and the food is amazing.  i expecially like their outdoor terrace/courtyard in the back.","Restaurant vietnamien hyper populaire, probablement l'un des plus fréquentés de la rue Saint-Denis, qui se gorge chaque soir d'habitués. L'ambiance a un certain cachet, et plus la soirée avance, plus les lumières se tamisent. Idéal, tant pour les tête-à-tête en amoureux, que pour les célébrations. Pourquoi? Parce que c'est un «apportez votre vin». D'ailleurs, il y a une SAQ (Société des Alcools du Québec) à quelques minutes de marche. Il est préférable d'arriver tôt si l'on désire une place, car  chaque soir est un « rush ». C'est pas croyable de voir rouler le personnel. Les deux fois que j'y suis allé, la première moitié de la soirée, il n'y avait qu'une seule femme qui s'occupait à la fois du service aux tables et des paiements à la caisse. L'on ressent une certaine urgence dans l'air, mais bon, rien de très embarrassant. L'on demeure conciliant.\n\nAutre raison qui fait de ce restaurant un lieu fortement achalandé : le prix des repas. J'ai pris en entrée une soupe tonkinoise au poulet (le bouillon parfumé et les oignons croquants ont fait à eux seuls ma soirée), deux rouleaux impériaux au poulet, et un sauté de poulet (je sais, ça fait dévoreur de poulet mon histoire) au cari pour la modique somme de 15$, avec pourboire inclus. Arrosé d'une bonne bouteille de vin, c'est compréhensible d'y voir autant de gourmands. La sauce de mon sauté au cari laissait par contre à désirer; un peu trop épaisse, peu épicée, et à en juger la couleur presque phosphorescente de mes brocolis, je n'ai pu faire autrement que de soupçonner la présence de glutamate monosodique. Je ne comprends pas non plus pourquoi mon poulet était grillé, plutôt que sauté, en fait je crois que le cuisinier fait sauter du poulet préalablement grillé. \n\nCe restaurant n'est cependant pas un indispensable. L'on peut même envisager de passer son tour et aller voir ce que la ville nous propose ailleurs. De toute manière, il pleut du Vietnamien à Montréal. Comprenez bien, je dis ça seulement pour laisser un peu de repos au personnel...mais en vain, votre siège sera vite comblé..."]}

Don't worry if you don't understand Italian, or if you're having trouble reading the handwriting; your waiter will explain every item on the menu in great detail.\n\nYou must realize that the restaurant caters to providing a 'dining atmosphere' rather than an 'eat and run' atmosphere. I make a point to say this, because I've read other reviews of this restaurant on other sites, (I'm surprised I'm the first one Yelping it) where people had complained about slow service. The service is not slow; the waiters are simply giving you time to talk amongst yourselves - something that we don't do enough of anymore.\n\nThe restaurant is ridiculously close to the Jean Talon market, and the waiter did tell me that the menu can change seasonly, depending on what's available at the market.\n\nThat being said, this restaurant is apparently famous for their Risotto. Personally, I've never been a fan of Risotto, but the people I was there with did say that it was among the best they've ever tried.\n\nThey have some very interesting items on the menu - this is not your typical Americanized Italian restaurant. Depending on what you order, some of the portions are small, but I wasn't hungry when I left. I had very good lobster ravioli as an appetizer, followed by lamb chops for my main course. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly.\n\nI got to sample (from one of the people I was with) the calamari and shrimp in a tomato broth, which was good, but I would've gotten sick of the tomato taste had I ordered it as my appetizer. I also sampled the lobster, again, served in a tomato broth. Again, good, but I would prefer it without the broth. One thing though; they say they use 1 to 1 \u0026 3/4 lbs lobsters for that dish, but trust me, it seemed smaller.\n\nFor dessert we shared the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake with espresso sauce. They were both good, but I would go with the lava cake over the tiramisu next time.\n\nIt's not a very large venue, but it did fill up by 8:30/9:00 on a Saturday night, so I would recommend reservations. All in all, a very nice experience, and I would go back.","Went here on a recommendation from my concierge friend. Simply exquisite!!! Plus my friend was treating since she hit the jackpot at the casino :) \n\nFor entrée we had the fried calamari and smoked salmon. The fried calamari's batter was soft and slightly salty and the meat was fresh and tender, it was served with a wedge of lemon and home made mayo. This will hit the spot if you like fried calamari. The salmon was fresh and tender, it was accompanied with pickled red onions and thin slices of olives. Hints of salty and sour on a canvas of fresh lightly cured salmon nice balance which complemented well with the calamari. \n\nThen we had 3 pasta dishes for our mains and skipped the secondo course and opted for dessert instead. The table next to us ordered the short rib main dish and it looked delish but sadly our appetite was not with us, maybe next time. \n\nWe had the linguine with lobster and rosé sauce, the risotto with porcini mushroom and white truffle oil and gnocchi wit four cheese. \n\nThe risotto was very fragrant, never thought mushroom had much flavor but in this dish it was very apparent, you could smell the porcini and truffle throughout, and the rice was cooked to perfection soft but not mushy, yum, by far the best risotto I've ever had! \n\nThe lobster linguine with rosé sauce was just as good. The pasta was fresh and tender without being mushy, it soaked up the sauce very well, so tasty I was already sad after the first bite cuz I knew I would crave this again the next day. \n\nThe gnocchi was full of cheese a little overwhelming for my taste but if you like cheese I strongly recommend it. The texture is very soft and melts in your mouth. \n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu and the profiteroles. The tiramisu was soft and melts in your mouth, with strong coffee flavor it was perfect and hit the spot. The profiteroles were crazy food. The shells were soft they were not hard even when served with ice cream, it was refreshing and drizzled with chocolate sauce yum! \n\nBest of all we just walked in with no RSVP and we were seated right away!!! \n\nGreat place, will be coming here often, the pasta here is really top notch. The pastas all come in entré and main sizes allowing for sampling if you like, the staff is quite friendly and accommodating."]}

The pho, on the other hand, is something to cheer about.\n\nThe soup is not clear, I tasted some hints of Chinese five-spice powder. The spices' flavours were not overwhelming, but just right (unlike some places I've been to previously). Their chop suey was fresh, and they offer lemons instead of limes. My only problem with the soup is that it was not hot enough to completely cook the chop sueys. Therefore, the taste of raw chop sueys was really a downer (still finished the whole bowl though).\n\nAs for their spring rolls, the texture of the vermicelli was slightly dry, meaning that they were prepared a long time ago. Also, the peanut sauce was not enough for the roll.\n\nThe service was very friendly, and very personal as well. With only two waiters it was fast and efficient; we didn't wait too long for our food.\n\nLastly, the place was extremely cold. Practically everyone inside the restaurant had their coat on.\n\nAt any rate, I'd give the place a 3.5/5 for now, and I believe that I will definitely return again. Hopefully, my next experience would be much better."]}

After the awesome pizza you'll order the eggplant parm with a good portion of their perfectly cooked rapini. This eggplant parm is the best way to eat eggplant you'll ever encounter. It almost serves as a delivery mechanism for cheese and tomato sauce. Rapini is a beautiful green cruciferous vegetable similar to broccoli. Eat your greens! Have a mushroom rice ball or some cannelloni. They've also got the best coffee on this stretch of Sherbrooke Street West. Have a cafe latte after your meal with a nice biscotti.

What a treat: the food? Delicious! Along with a warm friendly service. You get so much for your buck!! For a mere 7,50$ I got a full breakfast: two eggs, bacon, sausage, toast, french toast, pancake, beans and fruits. You MUST try this place!","I do not tend to give that many 5 star ratings, but when you add in the cleanliness of this pizzeria (plus a whole lot more menu items and breakfast to boot), it makes sense. Let me elaborate. I noticed how pristine the walls, floors and the general ambiance was the moment I stepped in for a mid afternoon snack. I confirmed they had renovated 7 months ago. The decal in the window states since 1965, so I can only imagine what it was like way back when. Now on to the food and service. Family owned and operated there is an air of pride here that is not always felt at other local joints. In no particular order, the burgers were straight up Montreal fried and dressed, in all-dressed fashion (ie. no mayo or ketchup) yet include vinegar pickle slices, shredded coleslaw, mustard and relish - like you get on a steamed hotdog chez a Montreal \"casse-croute\". The poutine gravy was a real standout. Likened to the kind you get on a good hamburger steak - not thick and goopy, just delicious. The cheese was not the squeeky kind, but did taste good with the fresh cut fries. Squirt bottles of vinegar were a neat accessory. Now skip over 18 hours and breakfast was also well above average. Their 'Le Brunch' plate included sausage links that reminded me of Picasso's (RIP), fluffy pancakes, french toast (simple white bread battered with a little egg), excellent feves-au-lard (baked beans with fat chunks), quality maple syrup (which can be subbed out for corn syrup in many places), tomato's or fruit (your choice), crisp bacon (salty, but not skimpy) and coffee (strong diner style) or black tea in a metal server. Other observations I noticed were many regulars reading their free Le Journal de Montreal newspapers. Fair prices too, yet cash only was the only real short coming I could find in my two visits."]}

It took some time for the waitress to come by with menus - this inattentiveness turned into a theme for our meal. To be fair, there was only one other waitress manning the tables when we first got there. But by halfway through our lunch, there were only two other occupied tables - no excuse for paying so little attention to us then. We weren't being particularly demanding - we just wanted our order to be taken soon after we had closed our menus (I don't think a 10 minute wait is acceptable), and for her to notice when we had finished a beer and offer another one. \n\nFood wasn't bad at all - decent portion sizes - but it would help if the right thing was brought out (twice the wrong item was brought out, both times after having had a discussion with the waitress about the items in question so I'd think she would have remembered). The all dressed pizza had a crust that was doughy and on the thick side, not my preference but it was decently tasty otherwise. The spicy sausage pasta was ok- it was quite a large dish, but something that you could easily make at home. The ravioli with rosé sauce was pretty decent. My mussels with Pernod sauce was good (though there were lots of mussels with the beards still on them) - it was a creamy sauce and the Pernod dissipated nicely into it. Only wish it came with some bread to sop up the sauce! \n\nOverall, the poor service outweighed the food and ambiance - perhaps it would be different on another day, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give it another chance."]}

They've been servicing the community for over 40 years and arguably The Great British Fry is their best area. Their pies are pretty sweet, too - especially on a match day if you're heading off to the local stadium!"]}

Unbelievable and the soup was absolutely delicious.\n\nI sat right at the back and there's a large window that let in the beautiful sunshine that made my visit all the more pleasant. The woman who served me was lovely and the atmosphere here is great ensuring that I will definitely be back.\n\nAs I looked through the menu I noticed that it wasn't only my soup and tea that were a bargain. Baked potatoes are only £2.50, a full breakfast is only £3.30 and if you go between 3-4 you're in time for Happy Hour when you can get a sandwich and a drink for only £2.50! What a bargain.\n\nVincent Cafe is delightful, friendly staff, beautifully decorated, excellent food at amazing prices and I highly recommend it!","No joke, I am sitting here in Vincent cafe right now using their internet to write this review. Currently one of the staff is discussing/arguing with an elderly gentleman (who can't hear or understand her very well) about how he cannot sit at the 4-person table that is available. This isn't the first time it has happened. \n\nI have only been at this cafe for a little over an hour and the staff have told no less than 4 different people, including myself, that they were not allowed to sit at the 4 person table if they were just a single or couple and to save it for larger parties. Well, I understand that but each of the people they have told have already sat down at the table, gotten comfortable, had their drinks and were chatting. I mean, really? Is it that important? \n\nAnd they only have one 4-person table and then about 8-10 2-person tables, so it's kind of their own fault for setting it up that way in their shop. Especially when all the tables are crammed together so tight, its no wonder why 2 people would want to sit at the 4-person table. \n\nAlso, I was using the internet there to do some work and every time the staff walked by they eyed my drink, waiting for me to finish it. Then the second I was finished they inquired if I would like anything else. I told them no thank you and then they cleared my cup. After that point I felt like I had overstayed my welcome because apparently their only goal here is to have a bunch of empty tables, so if they get a rush of some sort, then all the 30 people that come in at one time will be able to sit down...\n\nInstead they just seem to be scaring out the customers. \n\nI was really upset by this because I live nearby and was genuinely hoping that it would be a good place to work at since I work from home and like to pop into cafes for the change of scenery. Unfortunately this was a bad experience. \n\nI mean, perhaps their food is good as the other reviewer states, but I didn't try any of it, just had tea, which you can't really mess up on. So if you want to stop in, I recommend you get it to go and not to sit in."]}

Good smoothies and I liked the fact that it was all fruit (no sugar added).","Opened just in the past few days, so I and a co-worker decided to try it.\n\nThe restaurant is very clean and just built, and is well laid out. They've got plenty of seating and the kitchen area is in clear view as you walk in. When they make sandwiches, you can see them making it fresh.\n\nI had the Cornbeef Deluxe and a smoothie. The Cornbeef was fresh and tasty, and was carved after I ordered my food. The smoothie was fresh made with natural ingredients - I had the Strawberry lemonade, and it used only ice, lemons, and strawberries. The smoothie was a bit more sour than I like my lemonade, since it didn't appear to have any sugar in it, but was well within the scope of a good lemonade.\n\nThe serving sizes were good and the food was tasty. It would've been nice to have some chips or a side salad included with the sandwich, but the sandwich was large enough that a side wasn't necessary to make the meal filling.\n\nThe service was friendly and there were only a few trivial issues with the staff getting accustomed to the new restaurant. The only reason it didn't earn a fifth star was because the cost was a bit higher than I would've liked (~$8.50 for a sandwich and smoothie, with no side.) Nevertheless, I plan on returning there again for lunch."]}

Ya, it isn't A grade sushi by any means, or A grade atmosphere - we were the only clients and there was japanese pop music playing in the background - but they made up for it with all these freebies! First, and quite odd, I must say, they served up some warm donuts (not with the hole in the middle, but smaller, sugared versions). I didn't object, one can eat warm donuts anytime according to me, esp good ones. \nWe ordered miso soup (the seaweed was very fresh and flavorful), salmon nigiri, sashimi and a spicy tuna roll and a specialty roll, as well as a veggie tempura dish. It was...so so. Not terrible but not amazing. Still I will give them points on their presentation - these guys have an artistic flair, our large sushi plate came decorated with sauce that made out some flowers and a duck. Cute. The specialty roll likewise was beautifully decorated. \nTo top it off, service was top (ok fine, we were the only customers, but still, I give credit where it's due), and they gave us a fruit plate at the end. Oh, and....hot sake, or what they called fire roasted sake. Now, I'm not even a fan of sake but this stuff was good, went down really smooth. And it helped that it was on the house. \nSo altogether, not an unpleasant experience. Not worth trekking out for, but If you live in the 'hood, check it out!\n\nI would love to give this place more business, I would just make a few suggestions:\n\nI know you know how to make some kick ass sushi. Show me! Don't overdress your sushi, give me more tuna on the spicy tuna roll and make it really spicy. \nChill your beers a tad bit more.\nAnnounce your specials even if they are written down.\nServe fresh pineapple on the fruit platter.\nServe the donuts at the end of the meal.\n\nThanks folks, stellar service ;)"]}

A previous reviewer complained that they had to \"make too many decisions,\" but I see that as a positive.  The menu allows you to mix and match pastas or cuts of meat (fish, chicken, steak--portobella for vegetarians) with various sauces, all of which are really delicious.  You can also do a build your own pizza, and I know from experience that they're very accommodating about doing a topping that's not actually on the menu--bleu wasn't listed in the cheeses, but they were happy to put it on a pizza for me.\n\nTheir breakfast menu is a similar model, but they have nice classic entrees like eggs benedict and scramblers.  I got one made with only egg whites (they also offer Egg Beaters), and it was delicious and HUGE--I saved half of it for breakfast the next day and it reheated well.  This is typical of their entrees; the prices are quite reasonable ($10-$16 for most entrees) and virtually everything will make at least two meals.  Their biscuits are awesome; I highly recommend them as a side.\n\nI also particularly recommend: their coffee (I had the medium roast; they also have a dark one), their pesto sauce for pasta, their eggplant \"meatballs\" (delicious even to non-vegetarians like me and my boyfriend), their french fries (moderately thick-cut), and their wine selection ($5-8 a glass, and all very nice).\n\nI would avoid: their bacon (not very crisp) and the pomegranate martini (almost bitter and not very strong).\n\nIt does seem to me that a lot of their staff is fairly new, but everyone who's served me there has been very friendly and attentive and worked very hard to ensure that I had a great meal there.\n\nI haven't had a chance to try their bag lunches, but they look good (you can also build your own sandwich at lunchtime).  They also do take-out, so you can call ahead and place an order to pick up, which is easy and fast."]}

Once back in 2006(food was average) and again not too long ago. I have to say that the quality of the sushi is some of the worst that I have had. Fish did not taste fresh, poor sake selection, and the rolls were terrible. I'm guessing the only thing to eat in this restaurant is the teppan style cooking.. I haven't tried it yet, but you have to try REALLY hard to screw that up. I wouldn't bother with this establishment when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas. I'll save my tepanyaki cravings for when I'm back in good ol' Miami.","I was in Vegas for a Bachelorette party with a group of fifteen girls and we were all in the mood for meat so we decided to have teppan for dinner and hit up Hamada's Asiana since we were already staying at the Rio. We called in to make reservations to sit at the teppanyaki table and they replied back with how it might be hard to accommodate such a large group since our reservation was so last minute and the place might be busy.\n\nOnce we all got dolled up for the night; we were on our way downstairs to the restaurant which appeared \"empty\" for a Saturday night (and they were giving us problems???) The Host sat us down, gave us menus, and that was the end of it. We had to wait awhile until someone finally came and asked us if we had ordered yet. After we ordered, we had a drink or two or three or four; and it took an even longer time for the chef to come with his grill cart (pretty close to thirty minutes). Seriously! How long does it take to round up some beef, chicken, and shrimp for fifteen girls when the restaurant is empty?!\n\nAnd considering that we were here for a Bachelorette Party - imagine how rowdy we were since we were close to being drunk. Our chef on the other hand,was the opposite. Not entertaining, not talkative, not pleasant at all, he pretty much just cooked our food, made it into cute shapes on the teppanyaki table, served us and left.

I don't think that the Royal Buffet will supplant the China King down the street, as the Royal Buffet is smaller (a lot smaller, actually), but it definitely can serve a purpose - mostly because it is a well-tended buffet, and unlike the China King, you get fresh sushi rather than the mass-market variety from the China King.\n\nThe selection on the buffet itself isn't outstanding, and nothing really sets it apart from any other buffet (if in the area and looking for a buffet, I'd probably go to the Dragon House on Woodlawn), but it's not bad, and it does appear to be kept fresh - or at least it was during the time that we were there.\n\nMost of the dishes are pretty standard meat and vegetable variety, and service is good.","This Chinese buffet opened in what used to be the Derby Diner, in the Costco shopping center on Tyvola. It's barely a mile from the long-standing \"Super Buffet\" a little further west, so I'm not sure why there is a need for two so close to each other.\n\nThe Royal Buffet has the usual standard chicken beef and pork dishses on the steam table. It seemed like they were a little lacking during my visit - the chicken teriyaki tasted like simple grilled chicken. Aside from being well charred, it had no flavor. The chicken and brocolli was drowning in sauce. Something labeled \"pork chop\" was large slices of, I assume, pork mixed with vegetables. The highlight of the tables was the full size ribs, which were meaty and delicious.\n\nThere is also a separate area for sushi. Most of the time, the sushi at a Chinese buffet is sort of an after thought. Not so here. This is a mini-sushi bar with several different rolls and salmon, shrimp, crab stick and other nigiris. There is also a sign posted that they will make several different sushi items to order at no extra charge. I made two visits for these fresh rolls and was stuffed.\n\nMy glass of water was refilled often. The restaurant looked clean and the staff checked the condition of the buffet table on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with the Royal Buffet. I would recommend the sushi more - for $12 including soda and tip, a pretty good deal."]}

That'll be $25 and will be there in 40 minutes.\" He didn't even ask us how we were paying. Since we wanted to pay with a card, we called right back to give them the card information. The employee once again seemed like he had no clue what was going on and thought we were calling to add on to the order. He didn't understand we just needed to give the card information.

Growing up in San Diego, I grew up with some of the best tasting food around.  When I moved here I was unimpressed over and over again with the places I kept trying around the west valley and even the east valley.  At one point, I even swore off trying any new Mexican style restaurant altogether.  No more gross, greasy, no flavor Mexican food for me!  The Sonoran style food here just doesn't jive with me and my taste for flavorful Baja style food.  Yep, that's right...there's a difference.  Baja style is tastier with a lot more flavor per bite.  I have found that Sonoran is more bland and greasier.\n\nI was pretty skeptical when we walked into Jalapenos (Tio Freddy's).  But then I picked up their menu and saw they had Carne Asada Fries...a San Diego favorite!  Forget everything else on the menu, that is what I ordered.  It was delicious!  Not only was the food flavorful but Tio Freddy and his wife were amazing.  Even though it is a place where you order at the counter, they brought me my food, offered me sauce from the sauce bar, and came by more than once to check on how I was enjoying my food!  \n\nIt is a small place in a strip mall and I have never noticed it before, and I know others haven't.  If you want to try some great Mexican food at a really inexpensive price...try it out!","To think this place has been hiding around the corner from my shop for around 3 years.  I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place (Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants) and thought \"strip mall Mexican, need to check this out\".  \n\nThe place is brightly colored and clean.  The owner was bustling taking orders and serving tables.  It is set up as counter service only but the owner brings out plates and salsas when he has time anyway.  Interesting to note that all the regulars bussed their own tables and took the plates back to the counter, so I did too.  There are only 6 tables in there, each having 4 seats.  There is enough floor space to reconfigure a couple to make a long one.  If you get there during a rush there can be a bit of a wait for food as they is only a small kitchen.\n\nThe food was excellent.  I had carne asada fries and a fish taco.  I have not had many fish tacos but with Carrie's description of Baja style Mexican I figured it was a safe bet.  It was the best fish taco I have yet to have.  Lightly battered fish fillet on a soft corn tortilla with Pico de Gallo, lettuce and a bit of cilantro which I tasted before I saw or it would have been picked out.  The carne asada fries are a plate of fries covered over in marinated beef and then covered with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I would describe the fries as fully cooked but not left in long enough to crisp up the outside, I would consider that limp as a stand alone fry but for this dish it works well.  I also had a medium orchata.  The food is served up without much seasoning, leaving the customer to modify it as he/she deems from the salsa bar.  I chose to leave my alone and was rewarded with food tastes that did not require hiding to make the meal.  There was no grease anywhere to be found.\n\nThis is definitely a place to try if you are in the area and want something a bit different than a 'bertos."]}

WTF?! I didn't order double toppings, a-hole. Of course he doesn't tell you this when you order, he waits until you're picking up your pizza, charges you and hopes you don't notice the 70% mark-up on the price.\n\nHe then tried to explain that his way is cheaper by telling me that two large pizzas would have been $15 and he's doing me a favor and saving me money. So what you just told me is that because of your little scam I just paid $13 for one pizza when I could have paid $15 for two pizzas?!

What I will review is the service, location and general overview of the restaurant. \n\nService: These cashiers are hard workers you will see the same smiling face day after day when you come by and order your usual and trust me there are \"regulars\" at this location. Often times I'll be waiting for my order and someone will step up to the line and even before they open their mouth the cashier will say #5 with large sweet tea. The customer will simply nod their head. These cashiers know their customers. The managers here are also  very pleasant. This McDonalds has less of a turnover rate then some of the companies I know. I only have one cashier I try to avoid because she just always seems to have a bad attitude. \n\n\nLocation: Overstreet Mall, Uptown Charlotte.  This is one of the busiest lunch areas in Charlotte. From about 11:45-1:30pm you have thousands of people walk-running like herds of cattle through over street. When I say walk-run it's really just that! They don't walk and they don't run it's like a very fast pace walk, which almost feels like if you get in the way they are going to run you over. It takes some time to get used to once you start working uptown. Oh and heaven forbid you're a slow walker... you'll get some pretty mean stares to the back of your head.\n\nGeneral Overview: They actually just remodeled this location last year so it looks so much better. It's much cleaner and the seating is a lot nicer. At other McDonalds you don't have to wait very long before getting your food and at this one it's about the same, but because of the mass amount of food they have to push out they have a system. There are two separate lines. You have a line to order your food and then a separate line to pick up your order. Try not to get confused because it can be very confusing to newbies and throws us regulars off."]}

There was no evidence that the rice had really been fried and had no other ingredients in it other than rice and maybe some egg. My chopsticks remain upright when I stick them into the bowl. The consistency alone was enough to turn me off to this rice.

Cans of soda, plastic containers of what some call \"juice,\" coffee you pour yourself. I feel that these options are in need of improvement.

The 5 different cheese all taste the same -- basically of blue cheese. The starter was really good. The main was ok (a pie), but not very imaginative. I was also a little shocked that there were no fresh/green option on the menu. All options were quite heavy/stew type dishes.\n\nThe staff is really nice and the restaurant is quite fun. Lots of pigs everywhere, a few quotes on the wall. But the tables are a little sad. The menu is quite cheap, but still. Not good enough!\n\nI was expecting much better. Really disappointed :(( Sorry Tony.","Style over substance you say? You're not kidding. Yes, yes it's quirky. Yes it has all the little touches to make give you a more enjoyable 'experience'. But when you're going for a cheap lunch (which wasn't actually that cheap, for lunch) you need more than experience. You need good food.\n\nNow, I've eaten at Tony Singh's other restaurant - Oloroso. And it was stunning. Everything about the place is spectacular, especially the view of the castle. That really did add to the experience. But it ADDED to the experience, the main part of which was the incredible food. \n\nThis place seems to have forgotten the main point of a restaurant - food! I had the Chilli Pig Pie. Oh Tony, your names are hilarious. I mean, Chilli Pig Pie! Inspired! Shame about the food - bland, bland, bland. I wanted a real chilli kick, which I didn't get. Boring."]}

I ordered the ginger pear bread, mac n cheez, peanut-tofu-kale noodles, lasagna, tofu curry, and chick'n and dumplings.  Plus a container of bananas foster \"ice cream\" which I got for my friend (she did let me have a taste though! YUM!)\n\nEntrees run about $7, for a healthy-sized serving of homemade, mostly organic food.  (Read: you will be pleasantly full, but not stuffed.)  I think this service would be great for vegans who were staying on the strip and had a microwave and fridge/freezer in their room.  Or anyone really.  Eating out healthy in Vegas isn't necessarily an easy thing, especially for vegans and vegetarians who are visiting! This food is tasty and filling without having the overbearing fat and salt of restaurant food.\n\nMy dishes took about 10 min to heat up in my home and work microwaves except for the lasagna which took about 30 min in my oven.  I really liked everything except for the lasagna; it was very filling but pretty bland, overwhelmed by whole wheat noodles.  The peanut noodles were delish - probably my fave- but the mac n cheez was damn good too.  I would order the noodles, mac, curry, and dumplings again for sure! \n\nThe ginger pear bread was perfect- great banana bread-like texture, just sweet enough, with delicious chunks of pear! My dog agreed with me, as she stole half of it off my kitchen table! (and yes, I ate the rest, it was that good.)\n\nThey are now offering Holiday baskets that sound like a great deal: bread, cupcakes, cookies, and candy (hello, vegan peanut butter cups!!) for only $25.  Someone on my holiday list is definitely getting one of these, and I might have to get one for myself.\n\nI highly recommend trying them out! There is a $5 delivery charge, so I would suggest ordering lots of stuff to make it worth your while.  They keep in the freezer for over a month, so you'll have time to use it up.  Great for folks who are looking to eat healthy (especially lower sodium!)."]}

I haven't tried the food, but I have friends who have and they say it is pretty good overall.  On Friday night I think the beer special was 12 dollar buckets of bud light which is pretty competitive.  They don't have a huge amount of out of the norm for beer choices; I went with a Oskar Blues pilsner for 4.50 which is about the normal price around town.  There is a really large outdoor area with plenty of large umbrellas to keep the sun away which is nice and in temperate weather it is a nice place to hang out.  There are plenty of bartenders and servers and they all seem fairly on the ball from what I can tell.  I mainly picture this as a place that people will go to before concerts at the Road Runner or the Fillmore or hang out afterwards.  It is right across from Wet Willies and across from Butter so I am sure they will have spill over crowds from those locations also.  I have never been there past about 11 o'clock so I am not sure what it is like late night, but as a happy hour location or a place to go before a concert it seems pretty good."]}

Die Pizza sonst war lecker, schön dünn, der Belag war reichlich und es waren frische Zutaten drauf (und keine Dosenzutaten). Ich hatte Champignons und Schinken. Toll wäre ein schöner italienischer Parma oder so gewesen, hier war das leider \"nur\" Kochschinken. Leider, und deshalb muss ich einen halben Stern abziehen, war nur der Rand schön knusprig. Der \"Innenteil\" war leider total weich und hat eher an Pasta als an Pizzateig erinnert.\n\nDen zweiten halben Punkt muss ich leider für die extreme Lautstärke abziehen, wir konnten uns teilweise (trotz der kleinen Gruppe) kaum verstehen ohne richtig laut zu reden. Das ist echt schade, aber da kann der Besitzer auch nur begrenzt etwas dagegen tun geschweige denn dafür.\n\nSehr nett war, dass der Inhaber, als er reingekommen ist die Gäste im Speiseraum an jedem Tisch persönlich begrüßt hat.\n\nAlles in allem würde ich persönlich für eine Pizza definitiv wo anders hingehen, die anderen Speisen waren allerdings (wenn ich meinen Mitessern glauben darf) durchaus lecker und empfehlenswert. Wer also gerne eher Richtung Pasta oder Italienische Fleisch/Fischgerichte speisen möchte, ist hier definitiv am richtigen Platz."]}

Dabei lege ich auch viel Wert auf authentisch griechisches Essen, und weniger auf das Ambiente und die Umgebung.Darüber will ich mich beim Delphi auch weniger auslassen: ein Biergarten direkt an der relativ viel befahrenen Grötzinger Straße.

Die Lage gilt deshalb auch als gut erreichbar  Parkplätze finden sich nicht gerade reichlich, aber entlang der Straßen doch immer irgenwdo. \nDer sehr symptahische  und griechische! -Service passt mir sehr gut. Herzlichkeit, immer für einen Spaß zu haben aber nicht übertrieben. Das gefällt mir. Hier sehe ich gerne darüber hinweg, dass es die immer etwas mürrische griechische Mentalität hier keinen Einzug hält! Die Karte ist typisch für einen deutschen Griechen. Leider finden sich ganz typische Gerichte nicht auf der Karte. Ein Stifado, Gemistas oder ähnliches würde ich mir hier noch wünschen. Allerdings schmeckt dafür alles, was man auf der Karte findet ausgesprochen lecker! Das sind hautpsächlich Fleischgerichte, aber auch Moussaka oder Vorspeisen. Ich habe hier das Gefühl, dass die Produkte noch selbst gemacht sind, und nicht wie bei manch anderen Griechen Käsecreme oder Tzatziki als Fertig-Produkt. So bekommt man hier z.B. auch das Weinblatt warm serviert  ein Gedicht! Auch das Moussaka ist zu empfehlen  schmeckt wie zu Hause Leider gibt es den Beilagensalat wie so oft mit einer weißen cremigen Soße, und nicht nackt wie in Griecheland üblich. Scheinbar verlangt das der Deutsche Gast so  wobei ich noch nie versucht habe, umzubestellen, das muss ich mir für meinen nächsten Besuch merken. Auch eher deutsche Sitte ist wohl, dass sowohl vor als auch nach dem Essen ein Ouzo serviert wird.

Allerdings war der Salat nicht besonders, die Sauce war zwar ok, aber sowohl Möhren- als auch Rettich(?)-Salat unter dem Blattsalat schmeckten merkwürdig. Hatte ich allerdings mit gerechnet, da ich hier einen Kommentar dazu gelesen und daher vorsorglich keinen Salatteller bestellt hatte. Die Schnitzel waren ziemlich viel, soweit ok, die Bratensauce war wohl recht gut und nicht aus der Dose. Meine Jägersauce auch nicht, die Champignons waren frisch, aber die Sauce hat mich nicht umgehauen. Die Pommes waren halt Pommes, war gut.\nAllerdings hatte man -wie bereits erwähnt- so viele Tische und Stühle in diesen kleinen Raum gestopft, dass man sich fast auf dem Schoß saß und die Bedienung quer über unseren Tisch -während wir aßen!- dem Nachbartisch die Karten reichen musste.... sorry, geht garnicht.\nAn ein gemütliches Jubi-Essen war nicht wirklich zu denken. Dafür war es vieeeel zu laut. \nHier geht leider die Anzahl an Plätzen auf Kosten der Gäste und Gemütlichlichkeit. \nSehr schade. \nIm Sommer zum Draußen sitzen sicher nett, kann ich nicht beurteilen, ebenso wie die sanitären Einrichtungen, da beides von uns nicht genutzt wurde und auch wohl nicht mehr getestet wird.\n\n\n Unterm Strich leider eher enttäuschend.\nEin Gutes hatte das Ganze wenigstens: ich saß so nah an meiner Nachbarin vom Nebentisch, dass ich einen Teil ihrer gerissenen Kette im Fallen auffangen konnte..."]}

Ich war mit 2 Arbeitskollegen dort, wir alle waren unzufrieden.\n\n\n Die Lokalität: Die Einrichtung wirkt eher alt und kitschig, dort sollte mal renoviert werden. Komischerweise war der Laden dennoch recht voll, ich kann mir nicht erklären warum.\n\n\n Der Service: Unfreundlich und lange Wartezeiten! Der Kellner wirkte fast schon als wäre er sich zu schade uns zu bedienen. Höflichkeit war auch nicht zu spüren, nichtmal einen schönen Abend hat man uns nach dem bezahlen gewünscht. Mag daran gelegen haben, dass wir am Trinkgeld geknausert haben aber das gibts nunmal nur für guten Service...\n\n\n Die Speisen: Geschmack war eher fade, macht satt, mehr auch nicht. Die Portionsgröße war jedoch eine Frechheit, einer meiner Kollgegen hatte eine Lasagne, die in den bekannten Lasagneschalen gereicht wurde. Ich habe jedoch zum ersten mal gesehen, dass diese höchstens zur Hälfte gefüllt wird. Satt wird man davon also bestimmt nicht.\n\n\n Die Preise: Teuer. Ein Weizenbier mit 0,5L kostet fast 4EUR, eine \"übersichtlich\" portionierte Standardpizza mit fadem Geschmack liegt bei 8EUR.\n\n\n Fazit: Mir fällt leider kein positiver Punkt zu dem Laden ein. Einfach meiden.","Ich war mit 11 Kollegen im Il Teatro essen und nicht besonders angetan. Für einen Montag Abend war es erstaunlich voll, es waren gegen 20 Uhr fast alle Tische besetzt. Nett, dass wir ohne Vorbestellung (!) noch einen Tisch bekommen haben. Ähnlich wie von den Vorrezensenten beschrieben hatten wir aber eher das Gefühl zu stören. Zudem vergaß die Bedienung einen Kollegen bei der Bestellung der Getränke UND der Speisen. Kann bei 11 Leuten ja mal passieren \nSowohl Speisen als auch Getränke kamen recht zügig, dafür gibt es einen Stern. \nVon der Qualität war ich angesichts der defitigen Preise dann aber doch enttäuscht. Ein vorab bestelltes Pizzabrot war teils verbrannt. Die Penne mit Kalbsstreifen schwammen in einer völlig verwässerten, dünnen Tomatensauce und waren geschmacklich total langweilig (schade ums Fleisch), nur am Salz wurde nicht gespart. Für die ordentliche Portion gibt`s den zweiten Punkt. Gefüllte, frische Pasta oder wenigstens ein Ziegenkäse o.ä. on top wären prima gewesen.\nInsgesamt wirkten alle Speisen lieblos, der gemischte Salat mit Putenstreifen der Kollegin war auch eher 0815 (obligatorischer Schnittsalat mit Tomaten und einem Löffelchen geraspelten Möhren und Kidneybohnen), dafür aber ebenfalls reichlich. Die Kollegen mit der Pizza waren ganz zufrieden, wenngleich der Belag für mein Empfinden nicht besonders üppig war (vegetarische Pizza nur mit Artischocken, Zwiebeln und Oliven zu belegen, finde ich ein bisschen langweilig). \nAlles in Allem war es ok, aber eben nur ok und angesichst der Preise definitiv überteuert. Da gehen nicht mehr als 2 Sterne. Ein teueres Hauptgericht von der Fleisch- oder Fischkarte würde ich gar nicht erst wagen zu bestellen  aber vielleicht sind die ja besser. Bleibt die Frage, ob es an der exponierten Lage liegt, dass das Restaurant oft so voll ist?\nVielleicht kann mir ja jmd. einen besseren Italiener in der der karlsruher Innenstadt für den nächsten Besuch empfehlen."]}

Lediglich der typisch chinesische Duft lässt etwas erahnen. Deshalb habe ich es auch erst bei meinem zweiten Besuch in der Gegend geschafft, es mal auszuprobieren.\n\nAus chinesischen Foren wurde mir gesagt, dass es hier authentisches chinesisches Essen gäbe. Beim Eintreten fiel der Blick aber erstmal auf die \"Döner-Style\" Leuchttafel mit den typischen gebratenen Nudeln mit xy und den diversen Huhn-, Rind- und Entengerichten. Doch dann fanden wir unten rechts auf der Scheibe der Theke den versteckten Zettel mit den \"echten\" chinesischen Gerichten auf Chinesisch. Vielversprechend! Wir entschieden uns für Ma Pu Dou Fu (scharfer Tofu mit Hackfleischsoße) und Yu Xiang Rou Si (Gemüse und Fleischstreifen in einer typischen Fischduft-Soße). \n\nAm Tisch sitzend fiel auf, daß das Restaurant ziemlich viele Tische hat, was man von außen nicht so sieht. Die großen Fenster machen es recht hell, und die offene Tür zur Nebenstraße hat für frische Luft gesorgt, alles ganz angenehm. Natürlich ist das hier kein Sternerestaurant, sondern einfach ein solides kleines chinesisches Restaurant. \n\nDas Essen war reichlich, frisch, und gut. Es schmeckte wirklich nach China, sehr authentisch (man bedenke, daß es auch für diese zwei Gerichte Hunderte Zubereitungsmöglichkeiten gibt, die alle als \"original\" gelten dürften, je nachdem aus welcher Provinz der Koch stammt). Für meinen Geschmack, geprägt durch Zhejiang, Jiangsu und Peking gab es da nichts zu meckern, lecker. \n\nFazit: Mein Tipp, wenn man entweder Heimweh/Fernweh hat, oder einfach mal was \"echtes\" chinesisches ausprobieren möchte."]}

Etwas mehr Gemüse würde ich da begrüßen (wie z.B. im Juni-Spezial)\nLeider gibt's bei der Getränkeauswahl zum Menü nur die üblichen Süßpamp-Getränke oder \"Bonaqua\" - sorry, Tafelwasser lass ich mir lieber aus dem \"Hahne\".\nFairtrade-Kaffee im Programm ist lobenswert, für Besteller aber nicht wirklich praktikabel.\n\n\n I.d.R. kam aber alles richtig an, einmal wurder der Salat vergessen (und dafür nächstemal ausgeglichen)- das nächste Mal fehlte ein ganzes Essen, (dafür gibts jetzt einen Stern abgzug!) und der Rihkostsalat ist nur grün.\n\n\n Vom Essen selbst bin ich nicht derart begeistert wie meine Vorgänger.

Griechisch wäre mir lieber, beim Griechen. \nDas von mir bestellte Ofen-Lamm-Gericht hat mich ähnlich enttäuscht. Es war durchaus essbar, das Fleisch war zart - aber mich ließ der Verdacht nicht los, dass es nicht in diesem Restaurant gekocht wurde. Zumindest hat das Lamm nicht in der Sauße gekocht, in der es serviert wurde. Insgesamt eher fad. Das gegrillte Fleisch (auch Lamm) hingegen war perfekt.\n\n\n Die vom Vorredner gelobten Kartoffelchips fand ich auch gut. Allerdings kenne ich die aus preislich wesentlich günstigeren Lokalitäten in Karlsruhe unter dem Namen \"Bratkartoffeln\", was die Vermutung zuläßt, dass auch hier nicht viel Arbeit drinsteckt.

The front of the restaurant has smaller tables which looked like a nice area to get drinks and appetizers while there is a full restaurant in the lower level.  We sat down and informed the waiter that we were just interested in wine and a light bite and would not be ordering a full dinner.  He literally sulked and told us we must order a full meal.  We thought he was joking and informed him we would love to try a full meal another night, but that we were not hungry enough right now.  He then asked us to leave.  Seriously?!?  At this point it became obvious he was not joking and so we left.  \n\nHow is the food?  No idea, as we could not get past Cerberus the waiter from the underworld, but while we were waiting, we were given prepackaged \"italian\" breadsticks.  A good restaurant would provide fresh bread IMHO!!\n\nThere are much better choices in the area.","The Patio Restaurant is definitely not the best restaurant in Edinburgh. It doesn't look much on the outside, and to be honest, it is isn't up to much inside either. Situated in Hanover Street, The Patio Restaurant is in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and so it should be hot spot for people going for lunch and dinner, but its not - because it is awful!\n\nThe inside of The Patio Restaurant is really drab and dull and could definitely do with a revamp. I came here for lunch one day and I was really disappointed with my whole experience. This is an Italian restaurant, serving pizzas and pastas, but not that well. I ordered a peperoni pizza which hardly had any topping or cheese, and it was literally dripping in grease - it is something which I would only normally eat on my way home for a night out, not for a nice lunch. The prices were very reasonable here though, with most main courses costing under six pounds. The staff were friendly enough and the portion sizes were fairly decent. \n\nThere are much better Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of your custom."]}

Sadly, it scored a huge thumbs down, it had none of the fresh airy just-whipped today texture, it was heavy on the rum, disgustingly heavy on the sugar, and the four of us together could not muster up the wits to eat it all. It was a tiramisu gone wrong, a thick, unappealing glob of sickly sweet cream and to top of, a squirting of what I suspect was hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, and bad chocolate shavings on top.

Basically, it was a little fried patty with shrimp, pork, chicken, ground up with a corn.  It was deep fried in a nice tasting batter.  The shrimp/chicken/pork mixture wasn't the best, but it did come with a nice, sweet homemade sauce.  It was actually quite good with the curry that I had.\n\nThe yellow curry was plentiful, just like the old Essence of Thai, served in a large bowl.  It was a pretty basic, standard yellow curry with potatoes and chopped carrots.  The curry was soupy, but not as soupy as my favorite styles of curry.  It wasn't sweet at all, although the curry taste was a little bit on the bland side.  Still good though, and better than the places that dump a bunch of sugar into their coconut-based curries.  \n\nUnfortunately, I never had the yellow curry at Essence of Thai, so I can't compare it to the old place.

It has a bit of a rustic interior and has an almost cabin-ey feeling to it with it's wooden floors, photographs of local sunsets and a mix-and-match arrangement of wooden chairs and tables.  \n\nThere is a wide variety of dishes on the menu. We had a coupon that allowed two starters and two mains, plus two glasses of champagne for £24.95.  The regular prices for most dishes are reasonable (£9.95 for fresh haddock and chips.  I saw one of the plates and it was a massive portion!).  \n\nI had a pesto tortellini with tomatoes, red onion and black olives as my starter.  Starters range in price from about £3.95 to £6.95 and are a taste-tester size to get your palate warmed up for the main.  My partner had a starter-portion of haggis, neeps and tatties with a mustard-whisky sauce.  I must admit that my starter was nothing to write home about. It sounds a lot nicer on the menu than it actually tasted, with the pasta being way over-cooked and not much flavour in the pasta itself. Most of the dish's flavour came from the tomatoes, onions and black olives that were mixed in with about 5 tortellini shells.  I would not recommend that particular starter in future but there were plenty of other things to choose from including a smoked duck Waldorf salad, king prawns with mango and marie rose sauce; and nachos.  I tried a bit of the haggis starter. It was much nicer than mine but expect more neeps and tatties than haggis, and a miniature version of it.\n\nFor mains there is a wide selection from seafood, burgers, chicken dishes and several different types of steak. Since we wanted to make the most of our coupon, we both opted for the 8 oz fillet steak with garlic butter (blue cheese and pepper sauces are also options), chips, mushrooms, onion and tomato (regular £17.95).  I was expecting the steak with a few bits of the garnish and maybe a stack of 8 chips.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a good bowl-sized portion of chips, big mushrooms, lots of onion and half a tomato.  The steak was perfectly cooked and as a whole the meal was delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant on the basis of its reasonable prices and the steak dinner alone.  It was also noted on one of their chalkboards that Tuesday is steak night where you get two steak dinners and a bottle of wine for £25.  They also seem to have a variety of theme nights including an African Safari featuring exotic meats such as Ostrich, Kudu, Antelope and Zebra between March 25 and 27th.\n\nOverall this place is worth a visit if you are looking for something quaint just outside Edinburgh! It's easily accessible from the city centre on buses 26 or 44 (and potentially more than that!).\n\nI am still dreaming about that steak..."]}

The hispanic guy messed up my order 3 times out of 4 so far, he is the chef \"in training\" but seriously, its just wings, you make them all day, it cant be that hard? Mostly he makes the wings plain and gives you a tiny side of whatever sauce you asked for to dip in. This is WRONG. When I order \"habanero honey\" I want the wings smothered in that delicious sauce. That should be the default way, always. \n\nThis is in Cactus Jack's saloon, and the reason why I believe is because the bar rents out the kitchen to the Chicken Shack guys. From a logical standpoint, it makes sense because its cheaper than leasing one of the empty storefront's next door and installing a new kitchen, but it may be something they want to consider for the long run. I have no problem going in a bar to get the food, but I can see how some would think this to be an annoying and avoidable step.\n\n1/5 when the hispanic is the cook (so far, maybe hell step his game up), 4/5 when it is the older man."]}

Find a local baker to make you some premium buns.  You are charging a premium price so don't cheap out.

Then the Canadiens game began and it was even louder. For a place trying to serve fancy looking food, the ambiance just sucked because of the noise. It was not a busy night, so I'm not sure why they thought they had to deafen their patrons.\n\nThe menu was simple enough but unfortunately so was the waitress. This waitress was just not all there.  She was pleasant, easy on the eyes but that's about it. She took our drink orders, upsold us to the larger portion of salmon tartar and forgot to take our dinner order.\n \nWhen she came back with the drinks 10 minutes later, she spun on her heels to go do something else and we had to almost grab her to get her to take our orders. We ordered the flank (bavette) steak and she seemed to forget to ask how we would like it cooked. My dinner companion took matters into his own hands and actually chased the waitress down across the restaurant to make SURE she knew to put the order in for medium rare. 20 minutes passed, 30 minutes passed. No tartar, no flank steaks.\n\nThen out came the tartar appetizer at the same time as the steaks... The tartar wasn't particularly inspired, little flavour and served with 6 french fries. We dug into the steaks and, wouldn't you know it, they were well done to the point of being the tenderness of shoe leather and as dry as tree bark. 1-2 bites in we cut the middle of the steaks to see if there was any hopeful hint of pink, but no dice. The waitress didn't ask the basic  question of \"is everything ok?\" as we began our meal so we tried to flag down the guy in the dress shirt who seemed to be a manager. He didn't see us (or anyone else for that matter) as he just sat down on the bar and fiddled with his iPhone. \n\nWe finally managed to get a manager and by that time it was too much for us. It was a very unfortunate experience but at least the manager was kind enough to delete the shoe steaks from the bill. As we headed for the door I doubt our waitress had any idea what had transpired. She was cheerful and looked as if she was pleased to see satisfied customers leaving. Alas, that was clearly not not the case -  Factory was a total failure right from front of house to back.\n\nWe left hungry and disappointed, so we went up the street to La Belle Provence to get hot dogs and poutine instead.

You can bring your toddler here to play with lots of toys. You can sit on a sofa in the corner, drink a coffee and nurse your newborn - along with lots of other mothers, babies and children. It is one of the only cafes in town that caters directly to parents-with-small-children. So, it is a place in which you can relax with a cup of coffee and your toddler without eliciting the annoyed glares of other childless customers.

But the choices for beverages for little ones seemed to be exclusively ribena and sugar supplemented 'juice drinks.'

I'm from NYC, so I'm no stranger to rude waitstaff, but our server here tried to get us to change our order in a way that felt rather disrespectful of our dining needs--trying to politely explain our food allergies got us nowhere, so we simply stuck to our guns and refused to change our order to suit the server's taste.

Executive chef Richard Bastien is a genius! The flavour combinations were out of this world, and the depth was incredible. \n\nLe Mitoyen is a converted house, built in 1870. There are several separate dining areas, a nice fireplace, artwork on the walls, candles at each table and soft music in the background. Service was excellent - each course was presented with a description of the ingredients.\n\nFor Valentine's day weekend, a prix fixe 7 course menu was offered ($85/each or $140/each with wine pairings) with a choice of one of 4 mains.\n\nWe started with a glass of champagne and the salmon cooked \"sous vide\" - basically vacuum sealed and cooked in an immersion circulator, I believe.  Is was served on a rectangle of watermelon with citrus. The marinade was vodka-based.  SO GOOD! The texture of the salmon was amazing, and nicely complimented the crispness of the watermelon. \n\nWe then had a lobster tail with a mango sauce, microgreens, and tiny cucumber balls. There was a taste we couldn't quite place, and then realized it was vanilla (we think!). Whoa. Vanilla lobster? Who would have thought... ? Delicious! \n\nNext was a white polenta atop moist guinea foul with a rich guinea foul gravy. It was garnished with fried grains, rice and quinoa that turned into a 'rice krispy' texture. Again, awesome. \n\nWe had the foie gras, served with a winter-root puree, carrots and a roast potato and spicy microgreens. I'm not a foie gras fan, but my boyfriend love it. The puree was delicious!  (not included in the prix fixe menu - an extra $17). \n\nAfter that, we had a delicious bouillon,  with finely diced carrots, and something with a bit of kick (couldn't quite place it...).  It is served spoon-less, and meant to be sipped.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the pigeonneau (yup!! domestic pigeon! I'm living on the wild side :P)  with wild mushroom risotto, and what I believe was a kind of liver mousse.  The sauce was flavourful,rich, and delicious, and the risotto was earthy and creamy. The pigeonneau was delicious and tender.  My boyfriend had the lamb, and it was amazing! So tender, and moist. \n\nWe finished with coffee and desserts.   We had an amazing profiterole filled with ricotta and tonka beans, and served with lemon curd. We also had a strawberry soup, with basil ice cream. Oh. My. Yum.  Honestly. Holy Food!!!! \n\nAt the end of our meal we noticed we had missed a course - a cheese based dish.  Our waitress was apologetic, and since we didn't want it after our dessert, we were credited the cost of a glass of champagne.  We were a pretty disappointed to have missed it, since it likely would have been amazing, like everything else.  A bit of a miss given the calibre of the restaurant. But, c'est la vie. \n\nThe service efficient and friendly,  allowing enough distance for a romantic evening but always close enough should anything be needed.\n\nHighly recommend!

Yes, the place was empty and clean and service was ok, so no faults there. But what really got to me, and the big reason this place is two stars, is the following: when I ordered my asada, the guy pulled a tub of pre-cooked asada meat out and reheated it on the grill. That may be standard practice for fast-food places, but it's not what I expect from taco places. Not at all. I mean, making carne asada is the easiest thing ever: just grill up some flank meat, season it, cut it, put it on a tortilla. It's not like I asked you to bring me a space rock from the crab nebula, ok, so please don't re-heat my meat like you're saving all this time in a complicated process.

My friend was going to be interviewing the author, Roy Gill, and the illustrator, Paul Mudie, so I popped along to listen (and clap and make appreciative noises). \n\nPulp Fiction is a bookshop specialising in 'genre fiction' - mystery, fantasy, romance, crime, and science fiction novels. It's a gorgeous wee place, with lots of funny signs and a giant inflatable fish that roams around the room. It's not *really* my sort of reading - I like some of this stuff, but most isn't really my thing. That said, I loved the shop, and I know lots of people go there to just hang out and write during the day. \n\nThere's a cafe, too, with sandwiches, coffee and cake. We bought sandwiches to eat before the reading and they were delicious. But... just a warning for anyone a bit fussy or with food intolerances - watch them like a hawk! I ordered a smoked duck and salad roll. Ok, ok, look, I only wanted ham! But they had none, so duck it was. \n\nAnd what I got was a baguette with salad, duck, cheese, raw ginger, berry reduction (aka jam) and vinaigrette. And it was amazing! But.. it wasn't what I ordered. So just, you know, be aware if you order something. And give yourself plenty of time, because all that ginger chopping and jam dripping took about 10 minutes per sandwich. \n\nOch, I really don't want to slag it off - I loved my sandwich and I loved the bookshop. Go there. Just know you're going to get werewolves and ginger, and all will be well.","Is it a book shop? No. Is it a café? No. Is it Pulp Fiction, well yes.\n\nIt's hard to describe Pulp Fiction as anything than what it is. It's a book shop specialising in fiction, and I am guessing especially fantasy and sci-fi fiction. It has a hushed, relaxed and calm atmosphere. I really, really liked the vibe in here. The owner (I assume) of the book shop was genuinely warm and welcoming, but calm. Whilst I was there, some customers came in asking for book recommendations, he asked their tastes, then recommended. It's a specialist book shop.\n\nIt also has a deli café. But not of poor quality. Oh no. Look at the photo I uploaded of the deli platter (for £6). SO MUCH CHEESE. This could have easily fed 2. Three types of salami and ham, 4 types of cheese. The smoked duck sandwich also sounded divine but they had sold out from an event the night before.\n\nAnd the café isn't an afterthought. The majority of the store front has good-sized tables, at least 6 of them. I particularly mention good-sized as when you have a laptop and an epic-sized plate of cheese and meat, you need a lot of space.

I had the pea and my brother had the cucumber. Both very nice and refreshing and cutely served in mason jars. We then had the polenta with cod and the duck. The polenta was fluffy and the cod was light but creamy. The duck was deliciously rich and well portioned for lunch. And to top it all off, we had a chocolate creme brulee and a lemon tart. The creme brulee was a bit sweet for my brother, but I found it went well with our espressos, and the lemon tart was a nice combination of sweet and sour. \n\nOverall, a really great lunch experience. The prices seem a bit much for lunch, but for the quality of food that we ate, I really didn't mind splurging! We left pleasantly full."]}

Man muss also die Babyschale in einen großen Wagen stellen. Damit ist der Wagen dann aber auch voll und man kann nicht mehr einkaufen. Zwei Wagen zu nutzen geht alleine nicht. \n- Auf Grund der Tatsache, dass alle Eltern extra Wagen für die Kinder nutzen und mit diesen im 1.OG rumfahren sind die schmalen Gänge voll und es gibt kein Durchkommen. Die Gangbreite an sich ist schon nicht komfortabel in meinen Augen.\n- Um mit dem Wagen in das 1.OG zu kommen muss man den Lift benutzen.

I come here at least 2 times a week for their $5 salads... and they're not just lettuce, tomato, and a sprinkle of cheese. They're loaded with toppings, that usually include a meat. Their sandwiches are also a good size, all for under $9 and they include a side like pasta salad or potato salad (not the usual bag of Lays). \nOH, and the staff are phenomenal. They have a punch card where if you buy ten meals your eleventh is free for up to $12, and they won't let you leave until you've spent all twelve of those dollars. Even if you don't want anything else right then, \"well, take a cookie home for later\". \n\nMy only problem is that they're not open on Saturday or Sunday, and they don't do dinner. Sometimes I have a Friday night hankerin' for a BBQ ranch chicken salad, and I have to wait until Monday."]}

Also a great place for a light meal, though there needs to be more variety when it comes to on lower-fat items.\nIt's proof that a student-run cafe -- in this case, run by the grad students' association --  run by a local caterer beats out a corporate service in food quality, service and atmosphere. This should become the norm in all universities.\nIn my e-book, Food for City Building, I argue that cafes serve multiple functions above and beyond selling food. Above all, they serve as a \"third place\" -- after home and work -- that becomes a community fixture because people can drop by knowing they can either lounge around or meet friends or do a little work and feel as comfy as they would at home. Students, who face multiple stresses, need a third place more than most people, so it's crucial that places like this survive and thrive.\nA nice feature is that fair trade coffee is on offer -- very good taste, too."]}

I told him that avocado didn't look too well either, he continued to put it in the sushi roll cutting eyes at me. I then asked if there anyway that he could cut a new one, He rudely said no this all we have. So i told him no thank you!

I may try it again with meat sauce, but I am not sure, because it seems self-defeating in a veggie dish.\n\nThe newest item I tried was the  Chicken Chimichurri Wrap.

Fair warning to those sensitive to heat: this item is fairlyy hot (5/6 out of 10 on my random heat scale).  Though I liked it and it was tasty, it was a 3 ingredient dish, chicken, wrap, \u0026 sauce.  It was served with a few little, whole pickles on the side.

Except that the delivery guy showed up expecting to be paid (and since they outsourced the delivery, he had himself already paid for the order!).\n\nIf that wasn't enough, after a couple of months of not eating there, we thought that we would give them one more try. After all, none of the other burger places in Verdun offer veggie burgers. \n\nBig mistake. They put things on the burgers that were not in the description. Mayo on my friend's hotdog (mayo on a hotdog?!), cheese on someone else's chicken burger, a burger that was breaded and fried -- also not in the description where it was described as a \"chicken breast\". \n\nThey also put mayo /all/ over my tofu burger, and since I don't eat eggs, that rendered it pretty much inedible. \n\nIt was a complete waste of a meal for everyone involved. A waste of food, and money and time. \n\nThe olds joke of ordering out when your home cooked meal doesn't work out? Yea, we cooked supper instead after this \"food\" arrived. \n\nOn the plus side, it looks like they have resolved their delivery issues. The guy showed up around 30 minutes after we placed the order."]}

Sunset Rd and also to the West!?  Who is the historical drunk and opium smoking individual or commission responsible for naming this road in Las Vegas, and why is this confusing anomaly allowed to persist?  Could it have contributed to the low test scores of Nevada education system and the general dismal geography knowledge of the Silver State?  \n\nThis is the burgers and hot dogs restaurant inside the updated local casino now called Wildfire Sunset.  The fact that the internal atmosphere inside the casino and thus Wildburger does not reek of aged cigarette is reason enough to bump it up a star.  Plus it looks clean, the staff does a good job clearing tables as guests leave after their meal, and even the plastic beverage cups look refreshingly new, all contribute to a positive guest impression.\n\nThey have a simple menu.  And is operated like a fast food restaurant, where you place and pay for your order, and wait a few minutes while the kitchen prepares your order.\n\nFor the late night and early morning crowd (11pm to 1pm) they offer their breakfast menu (Build Your Own Omelet, Bacon \u0026 Egg Platter, Pancakes, and their Wildburger Signature Breakfast Bowl).  $5-$8\n\nThey also serve hot dogs (Chili Dog, Giant Hot Dog and Giant Bacon Wrapped Dog).  $5-$7\n\nHowever, I will go out on the proverbial ledge and hypothesize that most are there for something from the burgers and sandwiches portion of the menu.  You can build your own or order one of the pre-conceptualized burger combo.  The cashier told me the most popular is their Classic Cheeseburger, but they also have The WIldburger (basically the Classic + their signature coleslaw), a Cajun Turkey Burger (if you don't like the red meat) or a Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich.  $7 and up, depending on how many toppings and sauces you want on your order.\n\nThe Classic Cheeseburger was decent.  Loaded with veggies and 1/2lb Angus beef patty, and comes with a side of fries or onion strings.  The portion is large enough for all except amateur competitive eating contest hopefuls and beyond.\n\nChicken Wings and Boneless Wings with 9 flavor options.  $0.75 each when ordering 8pc, or $0.66 each when ordering 12pc or 15pc.\n\nTwo Salads selections, in case you are in the mood for some crisp fresh salads.\n\nDesserts selections are limited to Deep Fried Twinkies and their Made From Scratch Ding Dongs.  I tried the DF Twinkies mainly to see what it taste it, and can officially cross it off my bucket list.\n\nIt is a decent spot to grab a bite when you are keeping yourself entertained at this small local casino.  If you are in the area, by all means drop by, but with Wildburger locations distributed in various parts of Las Vegas, it is not reason enough to go out of your way to hit up this spot.\n\nSummary:  Inexpensive food that is decent, served in a clean and pleasant environment by friendly \u0026 helpful staff.\n\n3 + 1 stars!\n\n(This review is subsidized by Groupon Featured Deal)"]}

The guys ordered Beer and we watched the beers hit the bar counter and waited for over 5 mins maybe even a few more before the girl brought them to us. At that point everyone complained they were hot. I thought the food was really good, pricing was okay. One remark was that the shrimp tostada should have avocado on it not an add't 1.50 as a side. The service was really poor. Our orders came out so sporadic we didn't eat as a table. And when asked for the avo, she cleared our table and did other things so that by the time she came back with the avo he was half done with his food making it almost pointless! Had to ask for salsa and chip refills every time. \nWe started out as a table of 4. Then 2 other peeps came as we were waiting for our tabs. Because we all knew each other they slid another table up to ours and made us a table of 6.  Boy wasn't that convenient for our server who then felt she had the right to add a 15% tip to our tabs. I was shocked when I saw our tab! appalled that she had the huevos to do that! Honestly she forced us to all to over tip her. I saw no excuse for the lousy service we received so I felt she didn't deserve the tip she gave herself!\nAs we are STILL waiting to get the tabs, they brought in a band. All I can say is that they were to many members playing the stage! The music would have been pretty good at a different venue.

Es schmeckt immer alles anders als beim letzten mal und anders als man es erwarten würde, aber immer total lecker. Das Essen wird daher nie langweilig, auch wenn man wie wir schon oft da war. Die Stärke der Oktave liegt definitiv in den Gewürzen und im Gemüse. Rein dem Geschmack nach zu urteilen, wird hier so gut wie kein Salz verwendet, der Geschmack kommt hauptsächlich aus den gefühlt tausend Gewürzen, Kräutern, Ingwer Daher schmeckt das Essen sehr abwechslungsreich, frisch und immer speziell nach Oktave. Wer allerdings nicht gerne scharfes Essen mag, sollte vorher fragen, ob das Essen der Wahl heute scharf ist (ingwer/chili). Das Gemüse kriegt man nirgends so bissfest wie hier.

Insgesamt waren dass dann mal locker 1:35 h.\nBei dem Anruf wurde mir versichert dass gerade sehr viel los ist und die Pizza unterwegs wäre. Mein persönlicher Eindruck ist folgender:\nIch hatte die Pizza über das online Portal http://www.pizzeria.de/ bestellt. Dort hatte ich schon zweimal bestellt einmal an meinem Arbeitsort Gießen, einmal bei einem Event in Karlsruhe und nun ganz privat zu Hause. Die Bestellung klappte auch ganz problemlos, so wie immer.\nBei meinem Anruf in der Pizzeria Pizza Sofort (hatte mir die ausgesucht weil sie am nächsten dran war) war wohl meine Betsellung untergegangen, das konnte man aus der Konversation der Telefonistin und des Pizzabäckers heraushören. In diesem Fall hätte die Lieferung 35 Minuten nach Bestelleingang gedauert was an einem Samstag Abend durchaus akzeptabel ist.\nDer Anlieferer hatte eien Flasche Cola dabei, die aufs Haus ging aufgrund der Verspätung. Das fand ich als Entschuldigung Klasse. Der Pizzafahrer erklärte: es wäre gerade so viel los.\nZum Objekt meiner Begierde: \nBestellt hatte ich eine Pizza Hawai, 40 cm, für 11.50 EUR. bekomme hatte ich genau dass was ich bestellt habe. Qualitativ bleibt festzuhalten. der Belag war üppig und meiner Erwartung entsprechend. Der Pizzaboden leider nicht so ganz. Er war nur 3/4 fertig. Man hatte sich also sehr beeilt meine Bestellung so schnell als möglich fertig zu machen. Schade da hätte ich gerne noch 5 Minuten länger gewartet. \nFazit: Wenn die Bestellung termingerecht in der Pizzeria aufgenommen worden wäre glaube ich hätte das echt gepasst. Dann wäre die Pizza eben erst nach 40 Minuten eingetrudelt, der Boden wäre ganz fertig gewesen und mir hätte es auch geschmeckt.\nAber hätte, wäre und wenn ist eben nicht das Bewertungskriterium.\nSo bleiben mir nur zwei Punkte zu vergeben, denn es war eindeutig zu spät nicht so schmackhaft wie es hätte sein können. Drei Punkte wären drin gewesen, wenn man mir gesagt hätte, wir habens verschwitzt und der Boden wäre durch gewesen."]}

Nach unserem persönlichen\nEindruck, den wir hier widergeben, war es die mit Abstand schlechteste\nGaststätte, die wir jemals besuchten, und das waren schon viele. Leser mit\nstabilem Magen können jetzt weiterlesen. Wir suchten uns ein Plätzchen im\nGarten, der sich uns als sehr ungepflegt vorkam. Neben unserem Tisch standen\ntraurige Kübelpflanzen mit blattfreien Ästen aber einer Menge Unkraut. Kein\nProblem, der nächste Pflanzkübel strotzte nur so vor Leben, übersät mit\nBlattläusen aller Art. Für uns bis dahin kein Grund zum Ärgern sondern nur zum\nWundern. Wir bekamen von der Bedienung fix die Speisekarten gereicht, die nicht\nnur zerknittert waren sondern auch schon einige Flecken aufwiesen. So etwas\nlegt man Gästen nicht auf den Tisch. Immerhin konnte keiner etwas für den\nspontanen Vogelkot, der neben der vertrockneten Tischrose vom Himmel fiel.\nNaja, weiter gehts. Vor dem Essen wäscht man sich die Hände  wir hätten es\nbesser sein gelassen. Die Papierhandtücher waren leer, also bedient sich der\nfindige Gast eben beim Toilettenpapier. Die ungepflegte Schüssel (Haare auf der\nToilettenbrille) schmälerte den Appetit nun doch ein wenig. Die Getränke kamen\nschnell, beim Bitter Lemon war kunstvoll der Eichstrich auf den Millimeter\ngetroffen, beim Ginger Ale gab es deutlich Luft nach unten. Die Bedienung\nkonnte mit der Bezeichnung der Getränke nur wenig anfangen und fragte nach den\nentsprechenden Nummern in der Speisekarte  man ist ja gerne behilflich.\nAufgrund mannigfaltiger Erlebnisse in so kurzer Zeit vergingen die ca. 15\nMinuten bis zum Essen wie im Flug. Gereicht wurde eine vegetarische Platte mit\ngelben Linsen, bei denen wir uns nicht sicher waren, ob sie so säuerlich schmecken\nsollten oder ob die Qualität des Lebensmittels etwas gelitten hatte. Der\nBlattsalat mit Tomate war warm, was an der räumlichen Nähe zu den Linsen lag,\ndie auf dem gleichen Teller serviert wurden. Dazu gab es geschnittene\nKartoffeln und Karotten, die in einer Brühe schwammen und nach unserer Ansicht\nvöllig verkocht waren. Alles was ich bislang aufgezählt habe, lag übrigens einträchtig\ngemeinsam auf derselben Platte. Das Fladenbrot, das nach unserem Eindruck etwas\nmuffig schmeckte, nahmen wir zur Kenntnis. Naja, vielleicht isst man das alles so,\nunseren Geschmack traf es nicht. Der Bulgur war prima, da konnte man nichts\nfalsch machen. Jeder Kritikpunkt für sich wäre eine unwesentliche\nBegleiterscheinung, in der geballten Masse für uns jedoch eine Zumutung. Der eine Stern ist systembedingt zu vergeben, 0 Sterne fänden wir angemessen. Wir\nergriffen die Flucht und genossen woanders unser Abendessen."]}

We started with deep-fried softshell crab and a mixed salad (featuring dried cranberries, walnuts, and blue cheese). For mains (which we both particularly enjoyed) it was pan fried sea bass and rump of lamb. Dessert was a dark chocolate tartlet and something called \"munch\" (which turned out to be many little tasty desserty things on a plate). \n\nMany items on the menu can be ordered as either main or starter portions, which I thought was a lovely idea. I ended up having 2 starter-sized portions (for both courses), and it was more than enough to fill me up.\n\nOh, and they have a lot of cocktails. The cocktails, which are well-done classics for the most part, are about average-priced for the city. I've tried several, and I think the raspberry mojito is my favorite so far. \n\nService was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, if a tad slow at times. \n\nDisappointments: \n1) None of the vegetarian mains looked particularly exciting (though to be fair, I haven't tried them - perhaps they are absolutely thrilling to eat).\n2) No local beers on tap. Would love to see these added someday - I could definitely see us spending a sunny afternoon at one of their outdoor tables on the Royal Mile sipping beer and people-watching.","I visited Itchycoo this afternoon with the lovely Julie G and we had a lovely afternoon, so much so that we stayed and chatted in the lounge for several hours whilst savouring our afternoon tea and cocktails. I love the tradition of afternoon tea, and it is always fantastic to indulge in an afternoon of eating sandwiches, scones, and cakes. Itchycoo has taken the afternoon tea to a new level by letting you bypass the actual tea (or coffee) and skipping directly on to the cocktails. This is a fantastic idea (hey, if you're going for a decadent afternoon filled with cake, why not go all the way and get a cocktail, too!). \n\nItchycoo's cocktail list was lovely, and I couldn't decide between the Death by Chocolate or the Espresso Martini. The waiter helped me decide on the Death by Chocolate cocktail - it was fabulous, rich and decadent and definitely fit what I was looking for!\n\nAfter the cocktails arrived, our cake tower was paraded out to us. It was a beautiful array and selection. I think it's a general feature that the sandwiches at an afternoon tea are usually a let-down. The vegetarian versions we had were fine, but nothing stood out. We then moved on to the scone tier. The scones were tasty, but could have been a bit more fluffy and fresh. Itchycoo did very well with the cakes, though, which are always meant to steal the show anyway (let's face it). We had a banoffee pie, a fruit pie, meringues and carrot cake. I liked them in that order, too, with the meringues and the carrot cake both being fabulous. I was a tad disappointed that there was nothing chocolate included in the cake range, but then again my Death by Chocolate cocktail helped make up for that!\n\nWe really enjoyed sitting by the lovely windows in the lounge rather than in the dark bar area. However,  since we opted to sit farther away from the bar we were a bit neglected by service and had to ask three times for some tap water. However, that could have been because of the location we chose. Still, I wasn't thrilled in the service because I had originally made the reservation for 3pm but then tried to move it later to 4pm but was told that they were completely booked out for afternoon that afternoon so weren't able to let us come later. This was disappointing, especially because the whole time we were there it was extremely quiet with plenty of space at other tables, so they easily could have accommodated us an hour later. The online service was excellent, though, because the Radisson Bleu Edinburgh's social media people are really on it and were excited to have us come (as they should be!)."]}

I believe almost everything there is organic. They even have organic beer which I will be trying next time I am there. The service is friendly and the place was packed! Had a delicious savory cheese scone that was nice and fresh along with some ginger beer that was fiery and not to sweet which i quite like. Located at the end of lothian road right at the start of princes st. I will be coming to this diamond in the rough more often especially for the healthy spread of foods and that ginger beer that opens the sinuses!","I was unprepared for this. UNPREPARED. Beautiful lasagne, colourful and flavoury salads (shut up, flavoury is totally a word) and a chap playing such soul drenchingly gorgeous jazz piano that I had to stop eating on three separate occasions because it took away my ability to do anything but sit and attempt to breathe.\n\nThe lasagne, being (naturally) vegetarian, was almost more like a moussaka, and so delicious that I wanted about eight of them. I suddenly understood why the chap I ordered from had repeated my order back to me as \"one lasagne?\" But any more, along with the two included salads, might have destroyed me, particularly as I planned to sample one of the exquisite looking cakes, for which I barely had room after those delicious lasagnery salady exploits. I reckon five star lasagne with a choice of two out of nine salads for just £7.50 is a damn good deal.\n\nI then, as planned, proceeded to the cakery. The cakes aren't labelled, so I asked the girl what each cake was and she had fun matching the names on a list to what they looked like. I opted for the chocolate and lemon, topped with physalis, because it looked dinky compared to the others. Ha - WRONG! It was dinky in size only, but denser than a singularity and rich, rich, rich. A little dry by nature, it was served with a whole glass dish of lemon curd for my ladling pleasure. Ogh. I think I shall never move again, my friends.\n\nDark wood tables, a sofa at the far end, stone vault ceilings... It's a wrong wrong miracle that this place was relatively quiet when I appeared on a Tuesday afternoon, admittedly a little after the traditional lunchtime. I'm torn between wanting it to be as packed as it deserves to be and wanting to keep it as mine, my own, my precious, for all time. Because did I mention the free wifi? Oh, I didn't?

Never fails to rid me of the dreaded hangover. The Pizza's here are simply put as \"delicious\" although I've never tried anything else on the menu... That's why you go to \"Pizza Hut\".. Well you go because you want pizza right?. You totally have to try the Veg Hot One... With stuffed cheese crust. Too die for!. I Always order the platter as a lite-bite starter which consists of 4 breaded chicken a mound of skinned potato wedges with a garnish of parsley, 4 garlic and cheese bruschetta's, two dipping sauces of your choice. My personal favourite being Chilli, BBQ. Just because I love the sauces that much...I remove them from my plate so there not taken by the waiting staff. Use it for sauce when your pizza arrives. \n\nAs for the staff they're very upbeat and very friendly. Even though they are rushed off their feet as it can sometimes get a little busy in the afternoons. As a touch they speak to you after your food just simply small talk but I guess they treat you like a human not just a contribution to a pay check at the end of the month.","I haven't visited Pizza Hut in years, but today we had a hangover emergency with the SR, so popped in while shopping at Kinnaird Park. It wasn't a great experience but almost the opposite of pizza establishments (irrespective of being higher end, independent or another chain). This particular restaurant was absolutely heaving on a chilly Sunday November afternoon. Our poor waitress looked like she was on the brink of a breakdown (and looking forward to her break, I don't blame her!). \n\nWe went for a massive pizza splurge, and I had the veggie/hot veggie half n half, while the SR had the BBQ Americano/Cajun Sizzler. My veggie was missing spinach entirely, and there was only a suggestion of a tomato sauce on the base. Oddly, despite there being a strong presence of the other vegetables (peppers, mushroom etc) the pizza mainly tasted of slighly undercooked pizza base. The SR commented that his was the same. \n\nIt's strange really, as I usually find pizzas tend to be stinting on toppings, that here, although the toppings were generous, overall, they were disappointing, and I think it was a combination of barely cooked pizza (perhaps the ovens were overworked due to the high turnover of people?) and stingy amount of tomato sauce dressing. \n\nService wise was not bad, given how busy it was, and we were tucked firmly in the furthest corner by the disabled toilets and the ice cream machine, our waitiress was doing her best. Cleanliness was a little suspect - after having to return two dirty cups (and questioned as to whether I was confusing tea stains for food stains... but tea stains don't leave congealed lumps... at least not the brands I use), I don't think I'll bother returning to a Pizza Hut again in the future."]}

Aufrund eines Eintrags in einem Gutscheinbuch, der uns die zweite Hauptspeise kostenlos versprochen hat, haben wir dann kurzfristig auf Da Nino umdispositioniert. Dort angekommen, musste wir uns erst durch eine ganze Traube von Rauchern vor der Tür kämpfen, innen dann bis auf zwei alle Tische belegt. Die Gruppen waren meiste größer als zwei Personen, auf den Tischen waren nur Getränke zu sehen, es hatte alles Kneipen-/Stammtischcharakter. Schnell bekamen wir Karten, de facto eie beidseitig bedrucktes und eingeschweißtes Blatt Papier, eine Seite Speisen, andere Seite Getränke. Die Auswahl an Pizza und Pasta war mehr als ausreichend, dazu ein paar Fleischgerichte  passt. Unsere Getränke kamen schnell, die Pizzen kurz danach. Diese waren geschmacklich leider aber nicht der Rede wert: Boden zu weich, Champignons und Paprika aus dem Glas und klar säuerlich im Geschmack, der Rest unauffällig. Positiv: Service schnell, familiär und unaufdringlich, sehr faire Getränkepreise (0,4l Fürstenberg Pils gerade mal 2,60 Euro), sauber. Eher negativ: Pizza geschmacklich nicht erwähnenswert, Toiletten alt und muffig. Fazit: Das nächste Mal, wenns in Mühlburg sein soll, wieder zum Ritter. Auch bisschen düster, so ein alter Gasthof, aber die Pizzen sind um Klassen beser."]}

Umso öfter fahre ich nach Bocholt zum Shoppen oder zum Kunden, nur um anschließend im Subway ein frisches, leckeres Sandwich zu essen. Wem das Subway-Sandwich-Konzept noch nicht geläufig ist, hier eine kleine Einführung:\nZuerst wählt man zwischen 5 leckeren Brotsorten und ob das Sandwich 15cm für den kleinen Hunger oder 30cm für den grossen Hunger, bzw. 2 Personen haben muss. Anschließend entscheidet man ob's mit Fleisch oder lieber vegetarisch werden soll. Wenn man sich für ein Sandwich mit Fleisch entschieden hat, bleibt einem die Qual der Wahl, da über ein dutzend Sorten zur Auswahl stehen. Hat man sich entschieden, kann man sich noch eine doppelte Portion Käse drauflegen lassen. Das Ganze wird dann (je nach Sandwich) kurz (30 Sec) gebacken. Nun gehts ans Gesunde ;o) Es stehen zur Auswahl:\nSalat, Tomaten, Oliven, Salatgurken, Eingelegte Gurken, Paprika, Peperoni und Zwiebeln. Darüber kommt eine von 7 Soßen und nach Wunsch Pfeffer und Salz.\nDas Ganze wird von einem der stets freundlichen Mitarbeiter FRISCH (!!!) zubereitet. Dabei wird auch sehr auf Hygiene geachtet. (Die Arbeitsflächen werden regelmäßig abgewischt, alle Mitarbeiter tragen Einweghandschuhe, die meist bei jedem Sandwich gewechselt werden, etc). Dazu kann man, wenn man möchte noch ein Getränk (welches man selbst nachfüllen darf) und einen Snack nehmen.\nMein Lieblingssandwich ist folgendes: Italian Brot mit Chicken Teriyaki, doppelt Käse, Salat, Zwiebeln, Paprika, eingelegte Gurken, dazu die Sweet Onion-Soße und Pfeffer / Salz. Einfach lecker.\n\n\n Hinterm Subway sind ca 15 Parkplätze, die man Kostenfrei nutzen kann. Das Restaurant ansich ist geräumig (geschätze 50 Sitzplätze) und klimatisiert, was vor allem in der heissen Jahreszeit zu einem kühlen Snack einlädt. Die sauberen Toiletten sind über einen interessanten, verwinkelten Gang zu erreichen."]}

Served on two \"doubled up\" soft corn tortillas, with melted cheese, lettuce, avocado, and delicious lightly seasoned grilled ono, these were outstanding.

I ordered wings with hot sauce and the sauce had a very good buttery taste to it but not hot at all.  Suicide sauce was not listed as a option.  I ordered fries too, they're fresh made peel-on fries that had a good taste to them but under cooked.  The kitchen is open to the lobby and anyone with restaurant experience can tell that these guys are still learning how to run a kitchen.  They told me that they've been open for three weeks so far.  So with time I hope these guys become a well oiled machine!  Two of the three people working continually checked on us.  To this point I was not giving this place the rating I gave them or considering returning either.  What won me over about this place was the young lady behind the counter who I believe might be the owner came by to talk to us after the meal.  She truly wanted feedback on our experience which really shows she cares and wants to improve.  I brought up the \"hot\" sauce and was told that I should have told them to make the wings spicy.  If you offer a hot sauce it should have a bite to it without telling them I REALLY want hot sauce.  I'm not the normal consumer, I love extremely spicy food and these wings where weak so maybe a suicide sauce should be available without scaring away the 95% who does not want spicy to my liking.  My wife mentioned the soggy fries and was told that they are trying to figure out the fries and sauces. \n\nI will return and hope that they figure things out.

Food was ok; definitely not best in Montreal as some claim on Facebook. \n\n2. The AYCE Monday is misleading as it only applies to rolls (which you don't find out till you're at the restaurant), but some tempura are included. No soup, salad, desserts (this would have been fine had it not been for the steep price of $35/person. Not even edamame was included). Rolls with raw fish barely had any fish in the middle. It was mainly rice. Manager should work on advertising clearly and providing a separate menu for AYCE instead of having the server point out what is and what is not included. It confuses everyone, including a new server. \n\n3. Shrimp and any shellfish is imitated as the actual animal is not considered kosher. (I suggest not even having them rather than having imitated meats). Even though fish is considered kosher, they do not have unagi on the menu. \n\n4. (This and #5 were most bothersome). We were a party of 3 and we wanted to try AYCE, but server told my S-I-L that because she's only having 2 rolls, then she should just pay for the 2 and not pay $35. We tried to explain we're all sharing and she said that was fine. When we received the bill, we were all charged $35. It would have been fine had she just corrected herself during the meal rather than surprising us at the end.\n\n5. We asked to pay separately and she said ok and let us know that $6 tip was automatically added to each of our bill (at the end, it was $6.15)....wait...we're only a party of 3 and we should be allowed to leave as much as we'd like. Also I'm not sure how she calculated her tips, but if it's 15%, there's a bit of an issue...I know a lot of people seem to be confused about this, but tips are calculated BEFORE taxes...not AFTER. I don't mean to sound petty, but I was not happy with the service in the first place and was originally going to tip just shy of 15% before taxes anyway.\n\nWe were just so shocked and didn't feel like arguing about the service and charges; we just wanted to leave. I can boldly say I've never felt so cheated and unsatisfied as I did this evening. We will never return here or recommend this place to anyone. It's sad that the first review for this place is so low, but I feel it's necessary. \n\nI am not seeking compensation, but hope management will change for the better after reviewing this."]}

Most places around town I have tried it, I have not returned, call me picky I suppose. You can smell the smoke when you park your car. The place has been given a much needed facelift, it is clean, has a non-smoking seating area, has 3 different service bar areas, big screen tvs, a stage for planned DJs, bands and karaoke and an open kitchen. I saw a wood pile that they use to fuel the grill for burgers, etc. An extensive menu offers lots of options for meat, seafood and sides, we had the chance to try a little bit of a lot of things. I did have a chance to talk to the owner and learned the pulled pork alone goes through a 12 hour process to go from raw pork, to what is on my plate. He is also a former USDA inspector which is comforting when running a kitchen and dealing with raw product in food service.\n\nMeat Party:\nThe sliced brisket is tender, a little fat cap left on for moistness, dry rubbed spices, yum! Pulled pork is juicy and has a well balanced flavor, it is not served over-sauced, the way I prefer. They have wet brisket, chopped brisket sauced up, used on sandwiches, loaded fries and nachos. The smoked grilled wings, OMG something different in town, really a MUST try! Big on flavor, deep layers of smoke topped by a flame kissed skin. You can get them with any sauce, we got the 'signature' which is pleasantly perfect. Some sauces can be too sweet or too spicy, or even grainy, this was none of those, it was remarkably unremarkable (a good thing). It lets the meat shine through which a true BBQ lover can appreciate. They have both baby back and St Louis ribs, each has a nice bark on them and fall right off the bone on command. Also on the menu was honey glazed chicken, it is a top seller and I will try it on my next go-round.\n\nWe also sampled the southern fried chicken, such a light coating of batter but big on flavor, tastes like it had been marinating in seasoned batter for sure! The fried shrimp also have a delicate tempura like batter and are large in size. We had them as sliders, on Cellone's mini buns with shredded lettuce and a sriracha mayo. These were also one of my favorites of the night, unexpectedly. I went for BBQ, and came out in love with shrimp and pickles (BBQ included) PS- Get the fried pickles, just do it.\n\nSides:\nThey have everything a southern menu should or could have. My personal favorite was the house made cornbread. Hearty and sweet, didn't fall apart and was even better the next day as breakfast! Fresh cut fries and house fried tortilla chips as well. Next time will have to try the biscuits, greens, black eyed peas, mashed potatoes and the rest. The owner says they smoke their own bacon and hocks to flavor the sides with - most ingredients are made from scratch, he focuses on freshness and knowing where food comes from.\n\nI like knowing where my food comes from, maybe not the name of the pig, or what farm it came from, but knowing it was made with pride and so are all it's friends. I left with a smile on my face, sauce on my forehead, smoke on my fingers and an appointment at the gym for tomorrow. I give The Smokehouse Bar \u0026 Grill a high five."]}

They have a few different restaurants in Edinburgh, but tonight for the first time I visited their Roxburgh Court restaurant, which opened last year. \n\nIt's tucked away off the Royal Mile, down Mary King's Close. I was surprised at the lack of signs for it on the Royal Mile, but I quite liked the way it was tucked away. Like I mentioned, these restaurants always have some sort of offer on, so in we went, armed with our '50% off' voucher.\n\nThe place was lovely inside, and staff were very friendly as we entered. The menu was much the same as any Zizzi's restaurant, filled with pizzas, pastas, calzones, risottos and a few meat and fish dishes. We started with delicious mozarella garlic bread- this had got to be the BEST garlic bread ever. I big wooden platter, laden with melty, gooey, caramelised oniony, garlicky goodness! The portion is super huge so could do for 2 people (probably more, but hey, once you've tasted it you'll not want to share too much!) We also got some delicious calamari with a lemony mayo. \n\nThe mains were great too, I was there with my family and we got a whole mixture of pizzas and pastas. They do lovely thin rustica pizzas and my mum had something called a spiedini which was a sort of hanging skewer with prawns, salmon, sea bream, pepper and courgettes. At the end of the meal my Gran told us it was 'the best pasta she had ever eaten' so they were doing something right! We finished off with some gelato to share, and it was lovely (if a little small.)\n\nThe restaurant has a lovely view out across Princes Street and the Balmoral and we saw some Edinburgh trams passing by. With it being a large chain you sort of know what to expect with Zizzi's and it's not maybe the most exciting place to eat. Saying that, they have some great offers and the food is tasty. I think this restaurant was nicer than other branches I have been to."]}

The high ceilings and modern space has a somewhat standard feel (more common) these days. Three large flat panel screens display their sweet and savory crepe choices, smoothies as well as a full list of coffees. \n\nThe two young gentlemen serving the counter were friendly and fun in their dialogue with me concerning the Japanese style display case filled with silicon models of menu items. It's amazing how real and edible they can look from a little distance - save for the smoked meat model looked a little pale and more like a smoked salmon filling. \n\nMy new counter buddy insured me that it tasted quite good. I don't think they have that filling in Tokyo or anywhere in Japan for that matter, but I'll go back to see if he's right.","Had a super yummy ham and cheese crepe today for lunch. I treated my sister to a turkey and cheese, and for 2 crepes it cost under $ 13 - which is pretty darn nice. The two are similar in that they both come with cheese, the deli meat, corn kernels, and are topped with lettuce, tomato and mayo. They make the crepes fresh in front of you and it only takes a couple of minutes each, so it really is fast food without feeling like you're eating junk. We took them out for a stroll and settled at Con U to eat, but just a FYI: they come as I show in the picture, there's no real take-out package option. \n\nThey have other 50 types of crepes (I'm sure you can customize them too) as well as smoothies and a few other things - I was starving so I was too busy eying my crepe in my hand to check out much else.

Super quick and easy --not a sit-down place--Harper's is great if you're in a rush but don't want to settle for fast-food. It's kinda like a giant salad bar, except on top of salad stuff they have real food: ribs, fried chicken, pulled pork, mashed potatoes, collards, red rice and beans. That sort of thing. Comfort food, but done well and done quickly. You're in and you're out and ready to fall into a food coma. \n\nGreat dessert options, too, so save some room to check those out. But honesty, just make a heaping plate of mashed potatoes and pulled pork, and you'll be a happy camper, trust me.","I was visiting Charlotte this weekend, staying with a friend who lives in the area. She was raving about Harpers, saying it's her \"best kept secret, the place I take everyone!\", which sounded great. We went for lunch and had a really nice meal; the one thing that was a disappointment was the service. SLOW is the only descriptor I need.\n\nThe food, though, was excellent. We started off w/ house potato chips (my friend had never had these at any restaurant. That, I thought, was odd). The chips came with blue cheese and some blue cheese sauce, with scallions liberaly placed throughout. They were awesome, the perfect munchy to start off lunch. We both ordered salads for the main course; I got the Oriental chopped salad and my pal got the grilled chicken house salad. Both were typical salads, but the portions were huge. The dressing on mine was particularly yummy, and the Asian noodles were a nice crunch between the lettuce.\n\nThe slow service moment happened during our checkout--we tried to get our bill for at least 20 minutes before we saw our server. Even when she split the check up, she split the meals wrong and I ended up paying for my friend's potato-cheddar soup (v. good, btw). Oh well. The restaurant overall was a nice experience, and I have never eaten at a Harpers. Being from ATL, it reminded me of a chain we have, Houstons. \n\nIf you're in the neighborhood, def. check out Harpers!"]}

All varieties of tortillas (corn and flour), freshly made of high quality ingredients, plus supplies for tamales, tortillas chips of a variety of colors, and even an assortment of pan dulce. While I was there I was invited by the very friendly Plant Manager, Jasmin Garcia, into her office to see some of her new product offerings. They have an impressive line of offerings, including tostada shells of various colors. I left with a handful of tasty blue corn tortillas, healthy but very tasty whole wheat tortillas, and a batch of awesome tasting red child whole wheat flour burrito-sized tortillas that my coworkers devoured when we tried them at lunch in the office. Given that their products are affordable, made without preservatives, and high quality ingredients, I can't see buying my tortillas anywhere else. What a great experience."]}

All were pretty much as expected.  \n\nWe chose the non-spicy Naeng Myun, which is a giant bowl of chewy buckwheat noodles in an iced tangy beef broth with julienned veg and slices of Korean pear (the spicy version comes without soup).  We were first introduced to this dish at Hodori in LA's K-town by a Korean friend and ever since we've been hooked.  It's one of the most refreshing dishes - it cuts right through the heaviness of Galbi.\n\nThe Galbi came to the table sizzling on a hot plate.  The generous pile of short ribs were tender and well-marinated - obviously from a very good cut.  \n\nThe two of us were pretty full when the Bibimbab arrived.  We waited a few minutes for the rice to get crispy along the sides of the hot stone pot (dol sot) before squeezing in the spicy bean paste and mixing up the contents - shredded veg, beef and raw egg.    Despite our level of satiation, we still enjoyed it.\n\nTo cleanse our palates, the server brought us each a complimentary bowl of sikhye (sweet rice soup) as is custom.

We opted for some bbq and soon tofu soup (don't order this soup). We ordered beef brisket, pork belly and kalbi which was served with green onion/lettuce salad and around 15 side dishes which were very tasty. The brisket wasn't cut as thinly as I like nor was it well marbled. The kalbi was very good and the pork belly standard. \n\nI'd eat here again, probably during the daylight hours though!"]}

I decided to go with a dish I've had many times in the past, so I ordered Kung Pao Chicken with an egg roll and won ton soup.  \n\nThe won ton soup was excellent, and the egg roll had a unique crispy texture (although lacking in flavor).

Not to mention, they give a very small glass of water and aren't consistent with refills.\n\nOverall, the only thing I really enjoyed about my meal and my girlfriend's was the won ton soup.

Someone ordered Honey BBQ wings and said that they tasted like they had been reheated.  If you had a dish that required a fork, well you had to request silverware.

My meal also came with cinna-sticks. When the food arrived, instead of cheese sticks, I got bread sticks, with a heavy sprinkling of cinnamon and sugar. I called the location, and after being transferred 3 times, and 2 reps basically telling me I didn't exist as a customer because my order had been delivered, so I wasn't in the system, I got to speak with a manager. The manager offered to have someone come back out and bring the cheese sticks. So, I agreed. 15 minutes later, an unhappy looking delivery girl shows up, shoves a bag of bread in my face, and says, \"here\", and walks away. No apology, no have a good day, nothing. And do you know what she brought? BREAD STICKS! Not cheese sticks that I paid for, and waited extra for, but bland and unflavored carb sticks! \n\nSorry Pizza Hut, but I'm done with you.

My card is perfectly good but she couldn't get it to run.\n\nB)  She DEMANDED, and I mean DEMANDED another form of payment.  Well, I refused, because that card is perfectly good and if she knew how to use the credit card machine she would know that if you go a little slower it works just fine.  In fact, the card was used several times earlier in the day at several other places.  Being rude and demanding another forum of payment is already bad but you have no excuse to be at a window and not know how to use the credit card machine!\n\nC)  At this point I was annoyed, but she continued to push me by telling me just how her credit card machine works (by the way I am a software engineer and have worked on PoS systems and she ha no earthly clue what she is talking about, but I digress).  When I said to her, frankly at this point, and I quote, \"It doesn't matter now.  The point is moot since you got the card to run.\"  She then proceeded to stand at the window and say things like \"Wow.\" in rude tunes.  I said to her several times, in a monotone voice, \"Lady, I just want my food.  Can I go please?\"  She wouldn't stop.  Kept on keeping on in a test of wills with me.  She was way cooler then me man, working at a BK in what is probably her mid 30's.  I was doing jobs like this at 16.  Your parents must think you are the envy of the whole family with all of your success.\n\nD)  Finally when she did hand me the food, she said in as smug a voice as she could muster, \"Here's your food, dude.\"  At that point I yelled back \"LATERS!\" as loud as I could hoping everyone inside would now know what an idiot this woman is.\n\nE)  The fries were cold.  And she was so busy trying to how just how awesome and cool she is, she forgot the damn Sweet and Sour sauce that was supposed to go with my kids' meals.\n\nIn short, TRAIN YOUR EMPLOYEES!!!!!!!!!  I really blame management for this.  Managers, pay attention!  LEARN TO TEACH YOUR EMPLOYEES CUSTOMER SERVICE SKILLS AND HOW TO USE THE STUPID CREDIT CARD MACHINE AND KNOW NOT TO CONTINUE OPENING YOUR MOUTH AFTER YOU HAVE BEEN TOLD SEVERAL TIMES TO STOP!

Seriously, if it's not smothered on a plate it's meant to be picked up and it should be able to stand upright when held.  Either pack them fuller or roll them tighter, damn!\nThat said, it has no real minuses that every other taco shop in the Valley doesn't have, thus the average rating.  It primarily stands out for me because it's 24-7 and a close proximity to my house, which is to say that if you have an average taqueria that fits your hours and location already there's probably not a big reason to make a trip for this one.\nFinally, if I do go back (a certain eventuality) I will probably not be getting the fish burrito.

An excellent west side stop, especially if you work over there. Definitely a fun place to be a regular. Typical bar fare, but not too shabby.","The Old Town Pub has been a fairly consistent option for a beer and a sandwich when you find yourself on the west side beyond West Towne Mall.  Over the years I've been to the OTP numerous times, mainly because I found myself in the area and could think of nowhere else.  The bar is tucked away in a strip mall across from Woodman's.  There is very little else in the area and the OTP kind of comes off like a place that has never really worried about competition.  The overall feel of the place skews toward the regulars parked at the bar, but it never seems too unfriendly, just a bit insular.  There is a element of west side townie to be found on the weekends too.  This can lead to the usual aggravations like waiting at the bar for a drink while the bartender serves up all the people he knows, or the waitress engaging in long conversations with the tables around you when you desperately desire another beer.  Conversely these type of things must seem warm and welcoming if you happen to be a regular, which explains why there are so many of them here.\n\nThe food at the Old Town Pub is fairly standard bar food.  My father used to swear the chili here was the best in town, but I think the recipe was changed a few years back.  Don't get me wrong, the chili's still quite good but I believe they switched from shredded to ground beef and he says it's just not the same.  I've had a few decent sandwiches here over the years and everything is usually pretty good, but I stopped getting burgers because they never seemed to come out as ordered - either too well done or not enough.  The last few times I've been I've gotten the chicken wrap with the fries, which is perfect with a couple of bottles of Capital Amber.  I recall that when I first started coming here with my parents in the mid-90's the \"house beer\" was New Glarus Edel Pils, which was impressive since most places didn't carry micro taps back then.  I don't believe they still have this on tap, and I've had a few unpleasant experiences courtesy of unclean lines so I generally stick to bottles.  The tap selection isn't that impressive by today's standards but it is serviceable.\n\nThere is a nice set up of boothes along the back wall that gives you a little more privacy than the regular tables closer to the bar.  There's several flat screens throughout the OTP and the last time I was there it appeared that they have the MLB package.  I even didn't get any dirty looks cheering for the Cubs during the last series with the Brewers.  The weekday lunch and dinner crowds seem to be a bit more laid back than the weekend set, and the fryers are usually on pretty late into the night for appetizers.  The Old Town Pub is not usually the kind of place you actively seek out unless you're a regular, but I'm happy it is there.  Plus, the murals in the mens' room are worth a visit by themselves."]}

I hate to admit, I have been coming here off and on for about 10-12 yrs. It is close by and located in a dirty strip mall between a rib shack and a Dollar store and the parking area is shared with a Food City (closed now) and a Chinese food restaurant. Needless to say parking is at a premium especially evenings and Friday nights. I only go there when I don't feel like cooking dinner or there is nothing in the frig. (plus it's cheap $5 for a lg. pepperoni)  I usually call in advance for my order and it is always ready and on time because after looking for a place to park and going to the counter passing a hoard to the counter takes about 20 to 30 min. The interior is about the size of an elevator and is packed like sardines. (Big time B. O.)  After making it to the counter and waiting to pick up my order I get a chance to watch the kitchen staff. Unlike most of the customers, I am about 6ft. tall and have a good vantage point. If you want to eat your pizza don't look. Just put your blinds on and leave quickly. Hopefully your car is still there. But if you decide to look you will notice food prep without gloves, no hair nets, cashiers handling food after handling money, staff eating while working, half eaten pizzas on working surfaces, phone orders being taken while eating or boxing up your order, flies in the window dead and alive, walls and floors thick with grime, kitchen area and equipment filthy with old grease, workers unkempt, dirty and disheveled looking. Pretty sad, to say the least, but surprisingly I have never gotten \"physically\" ill ( I think I have built up a tolerance/ immunity or lucky) and the pizzas taste pretty darn good and hot. They have never messed up my order either. AMAZING!! If you do decide to go...enter at your own risk.  I will probably go there again and push my luck. I just wish they would clean up their act!!!

It was gooey, brownish, and glued to the top bun which was otherwise toasted and dry. I really cannot express the level if disappointment I experienced today for lunch. To do so would make you cry and wish to toss yourself in front of a bus and end it all. Terrible lunch today."]}

You can either park and go to the pick up window to order or drive thru (although there is no menu nor a speaker system so you are literally driving up to a different pick up menu).  For speed's sake, I suggest parking your car and ordering at the window or phoning in your order to really save time as efficiency is not H and H's strong suit, food is.\n\nWhen going there, winners are the smothered specials with 2 sides and a bread ($5 for chicken and $6 for pork chop) and any of the meat combos (rib tips, pulled pork, etc) (something like $5-$9 depending on which meat and small or large)  Tasty stuff!\n\nThey also do a lot of fried fish that the charge by the pound (~$6.50/POUND).  The sides were typical of a soul food restaurant (black eyed peas, greens, mac and cheese, etc).  they were all fine, but the meat is the real star of the show.  I'm tempted to try their banana pudding, cobblers, sweet tea, and kool aid the next time I go back.  If only it wasn't so dang far.\n\nAll in all, this place is CHEAP and TASTY. Note, there are no tables and chairs. This is LITERALLY a shack. They even bar b q in the parking lot. Mind you, that's the tastiest parking lot food I've ever had.\nGO WHEN IT'S DAYLIGHT"]}

Their hookahs are not good, and you practically have to tackle an employee if you want more coals.\n\nSave yourself the frustration and go to Urban Cafe or King Tuts.

This was the worst and the cheapest tasting pizza that we have had in some time.

They always seem to be empty when we eat next door at the GREAT Mexican restaurant.  I don't think they will be in business for very long.","Not sure what happened with the first review, but I met the Danish woman and was a fan too.  She and her husband work really hard.  I ended up going here because (1) it's close in Anthem and (2) I had purchased a restaurant.com coupon to try it out ($25 gift certificate for $2 with a minimum purchase of $35).\n\n'Knowing that we needed to spend at least $35, we got to a try a large pizza and a couple of salads.  I would say the freshness and taste of the salad was more appealing than the pizza.  Although the pizza is definitely tasty and fresh too, it's just not what I am into as it had a cornmeal type thick crust. Call me low class in the pizza category, but I am a big fan of Domino's thin crust.  For fancy pizzas, I love Stratta at the Wynn. However, I don't like deep dish or thick crust which is why I am not the hugest fan of the pizza here.  So, if you like something with a thicker crust, this could be your place. It's nothing against the, it's just the style they do.\n\nAlso, the decoration is charming and it's clean.  The prices are more than reasonable especially considering its location and I really hope that this business makes it as they do make a quality product and put heart into their cooking and ambiance."]}

L'ambiance a un certain cachet, et plus la soirée avance, plus les lumières se tamisent. Idéal, tant pour les tête-à-tête en amoureux, que pour les célébrations. Pourquoi? Parce que c'est un «apportez votre vin». D'ailleurs, il y a une SAQ (Société des Alcools du Québec) à quelques minutes de marche. Il est préférable d'arriver tôt si l'on désire une place, car  chaque soir est un « rush ». C'est pas croyable de voir rouler le personnel.

Arrosé d'une bonne bouteille de vin, c'est compréhensible d'y voir autant de gourmands. La sauce de mon sauté au cari laissait par contre à désirer; un peu trop épaisse, peu épicée, et à en juger la couleur presque phosphorescente de mes brocolis, je n'ai pu faire autrement que de soupçonner la présence de glutamate monosodique.

Don't worry if you don't understand Italian, or if you're having trouble reading the handwriting; your waiter will explain every item on the menu in great detail.\n\nYou must realize that the restaurant caters to providing a 'dining atmosphere' rather than an 'eat and run' atmosphere. I make a point to say this, because I've read other reviews of this restaurant on other sites, (I'm surprised I'm the first one Yelping it) where people had complained about slow service. The service is not slow; the waiters are simply giving you time to talk amongst yourselves - something that we don't do enough of anymore.\n\nThe restaurant is ridiculously close to the Jean Talon market, and the waiter did tell me that the menu can change seasonly, depending on what's available at the market.\n\nThat being said, this restaurant is apparently famous for their Risotto. Personally, I've never been a fan of Risotto, but the people I was there with did say that it was among the best they've ever tried.\n\nThey have some very interesting items on the menu - this is not your typical Americanized Italian restaurant. Depending on what you order, some of the portions are small, but I wasn't hungry when I left. I had very good lobster ravioli as an appetizer, followed by lamb chops for my main course. The lamb chops were cooked perfectly.\n\nI got to sample (from one of the people I was with) the calamari and shrimp in a tomato broth, which was good, but I would've gotten sick of the tomato taste had I ordered it as my appetizer. I also sampled the lobster, again, served in a tomato broth. Again, good, but I would prefer it without the broth. One thing though; they say they use 1 to 1 \u0026 3/4 lbs lobsters for that dish, but trust me, it seemed smaller.\n\nFor dessert we shared the tiramisu and chocolate lava cake with espresso sauce. They were both good, but I would go with the lava cake over the tiramisu next time.\n\nIt's not a very large venue, but it did fill up by 8:30/9:00 on a Saturday night, so I would recommend reservations. All in all, a very nice experience, and I would go back.","Went here on a recommendation from my concierge friend. Simply exquisite!!! Plus my friend was treating since she hit the jackpot at the casino :) \n\nFor entrée we had the fried calamari and smoked salmon. The fried calamari's batter was soft and slightly salty and the meat was fresh and tender, it was served with a wedge of lemon and home made mayo. This will hit the spot if you like fried calamari. The salmon was fresh and tender, it was accompanied with pickled red onions and thin slices of olives. Hints of salty and sour on a canvas of fresh lightly cured salmon nice balance which complemented well with the calamari. \n\nThen we had 3 pasta dishes for our mains and skipped the secondo course and opted for dessert instead. The table next to us ordered the short rib main dish and it looked delish but sadly our appetite was not with us, maybe next time. \n\nWe had the linguine with lobster and rosé sauce, the risotto with porcini mushroom and white truffle oil and gnocchi wit four cheese. \n\nThe risotto was very fragrant, never thought mushroom had much flavor but in this dish it was very apparent, you could smell the porcini and truffle throughout, and the rice was cooked to perfection soft but not mushy, yum, by far the best risotto I've ever had! \n\nThe lobster linguine with rosé sauce was just as good. The pasta was fresh and tender without being mushy, it soaked up the sauce very well, so tasty I was already sad after the first bite cuz I knew I would crave this again the next day. \n\nThe gnocchi was full of cheese a little overwhelming for my taste but if you like cheese I strongly recommend it. The texture is very soft and melts in your mouth. \n\nFor dessert we had the tiramisu and the profiteroles. The tiramisu was soft and melts in your mouth, with strong coffee flavor it was perfect and hit the spot. The profiteroles were crazy food. The shells were soft they were not hard even when served with ice cream, it was refreshing and drizzled with chocolate sauce yum! \n\nBest of all we just walked in with no RSVP and we were seated right away!!! \n\nGreat place, will be coming here often, the pasta here is really top notch. The pastas all come in entré and main sizes allowing for sampling if you like, the staff is quite friendly and accommodating."]}

I ordered it as a slush, which was way too good.  The only problem is that it had very large chunks of ice in it, which made drinking it awkward.  I'd suggest not getting the slush; just keep it simple and get it as a liquid.\n\nI didn't like the plantains, though I'm a hard sell on that, since I don't like bananas much.

The decal in the window states since 1965, so I can only imagine what it was like way back when. Now on to the food and service. Family owned and operated there is an air of pride here that is not always felt at other local joints.

The poutine gravy was a real standout. Likened to the kind you get on a good hamburger steak - not thick and goopy, just delicious. The cheese was not the squeeky kind, but did taste good with the fresh cut fries. Squirt bottles of vinegar were a neat accessory. Now skip over 18 hours and breakfast was also well above average. Their 'Le Brunch' plate included sausage links that reminded me of Picasso's (RIP), fluffy pancakes, french toast (simple white bread battered with a little egg), excellent feves-au-lard (baked beans with fat chunks), quality maple syrup (which can be subbed out for corn syrup in many places), tomato's or fruit (your choice), crisp bacon (salty, but not skimpy) and coffee (strong diner style) or black tea in a metal server.

It took some time for the waitress to come by with menus - this inattentiveness turned into a theme for our meal. To be fair, there was only one other waitress manning the tables when we first got there. But by halfway through our lunch, there were only two other occupied tables - no excuse for paying so little attention to us then. We weren't being particularly demanding - we just wanted our order to be taken soon after we had closed our menus (I don't think a 10 minute wait is acceptable), and for her to notice when we had finished a beer and offer another one. \n\nFood wasn't bad at all - decent portion sizes - but it would help if the right thing was brought out (twice the wrong item was brought out, both times after having had a discussion with the waitress about the items in question so I'd think she would have remembered). The all dressed pizza had a crust that was doughy and on the thick side, not my preference but it was decently tasty otherwise. The spicy sausage pasta was ok- it was quite a large dish, but something that you could easily make at home. The ravioli with rosé sauce was pretty decent. My mussels with Pernod sauce was good (though there were lots of mussels with the beards still on them) - it was a creamy sauce and the Pernod dissipated nicely into it. Only wish it came with some bread to sop up the sauce! \n\nOverall, the poor service outweighed the food and ambiance - perhaps it would be different on another day, but I'm not sure I'm willing to give it another chance."]}

It was one of the pretty few and far between bars in Edinburgh where I felt completely comfortable and part of the banter within five minutes of being in the place. \n\nSt Vincent is frequented by a lot of regulars, but not the kind of regulars that put their pint glasses down and fix you with a steely stare in silence as you creak the pub door open, and then through which you inevitably awkwardly feel like you should creep back out of again.

Fusion restaurants don't tend to tempt me - stick to making one cuisine good rather than trying to please everyone, it never really works that well. \n\nExtra star for the Japanese tea, not enough places serve it."]}

That doesn't make it bad, but don't expect anything too unexpected. There are some slightly different dishes, at least at first sight, for example their Melanzane Parmigiana (aubergine in tomato sauce) but these are mostly just variations on classics. However within this limitation there is actually a very large menu, and you will find yourself still hard pressed to choose. Expect decent quality and good portions. \n\nThe interior is nice, not too fancy but good enough for a special occasion and appropriate for dressy or more casual wear. The place is family run and has a friendly feel.\n\nWhat does make La Rusticana a treat is their very reasonable prices. A business lunch, three courses, costs only £5.45. A  real bargain considering! \n\nA great lunch time option with a vast traditional Italian menu.","If you are in the mood for a delicious Italian meal, La Rusticana is the place to go. Situated on Cockburn Road, La Rusticana is just a short walk from the city centre and is just around the corner from the Royal Mile and so it is convenient place to reach. \n\nTheir menu offers an extensive range of authentic Italian dishes and I love to come here for my dinner in the evenings. Their starters include traditional Italian dishes including bruschetta and melon and ham, but there are more exotic entry's too such as snails La Rusticana pizza's are some of my favourite's in the city as the base is super thin and doughy with no burnt bits! They always add lots of toppings and don't skimp on the cheese which is always a bonus. They also have a vast selection of pasta dishes and their spaghetti with clams and tomato's is particularly gorgeous. La Rusticana also serve a selection of meat dishes including steak, chicken and veal. \n\nThe prices are incredibly reasonable here, with pasta and pizza dishes costing about £6 - what a bargain. There are a vast range of wines available and the house red which I had was really tasty and inexpensive but it didn't taste cheap. A great place to go for a tasty Italian meal."]}

However, the food isn't bad and the price refelcts my initial judgment - stuck in the seventies, but I certainly won't complain about that!\n\nWhat Wong's also offers is a 'Crunch Lunch', £4 for 2 courses with a soft drink, now you can't say fairer than that!

A good rule of thumb as to the quality of oft-frequented chains is how often they've gotten your order wrong.

This isn't the first time it has happened. \n\nI have only been at this cafe for a little over an hour and the staff have told no less than 4 different people, including myself, that they were not allowed to sit at the 4 person table if they were just a single or couple and to save it for larger parties.

I  freaked out and kindly asked the waiter to go check out behind the fire extinguishers in the corner as I saw the mouse hiding behind them.

Eventually, he worked up enough courage to go check out the extinguishers, only to find a mouse hiding there in a \"surprise\"\n\nNot sure how great the food is (I'm sure it's very tasty because chinese food are very tasty) but I ended up walking away because I totally lost my appetite. I can understand that these kinds of things can happen due to the building being old, but still, I did not receive a single apology from the waiters, only to be greeted by 'hey it's only a small mice' by a young man working there.

For example it's possible to have haggis samosas, salmon filled naan (defininitely a first) and for dessert Indian carrot cake!

Their biscuits are awesome; I highly recommend them as a side.\n\nI also particularly recommend: their coffee (I had the medium roast; they also have a dark one), their pesto sauce for pasta, their eggplant \"meatballs\" (delicious even to non-vegetarians like me and my boyfriend), their french fries (moderately thick-cut), and their wine selection ($5-8 a glass, and all very nice).\n\nI would avoid: their bacon (not very crisp) and the pomegranate martini (almost bitter and not very strong).\n\nIt does seem to me that a lot of their staff is fairly new, but everyone who's served me there has been very friendly and attentive and worked very hard to ensure that I had a great meal there.\n\nI haven't had a chance to try their bag lunches, but they look good (you can also build your own sandwich at lunchtime).  They also do take-out, so you can call ahead and place an order to pick up, which is easy and fast."]}

However, this truned out to be the peak of my Pallucci experience, as the evening plateued shortly after. While the staff remained friendly and helpful, there were points when it was difficult to get hold of them, and despite thier initial speed at taking orders etc, by the time we were ready to order our food, there was nobody in sight.\n\nRegardless, once our food had arrived it was delicious - big, hearty Italian flavours all around - a real pleasure to eat. However, there were complaints from within my party (small things such as steak not being cooked right etc) which was enough to cause more than a few grumbles around our table.\n\nThe cost of all this was reasonable, and we left with a smile on our face and good food in our stomachs."]}

Once back in 2006(food was average) and again not too long ago. I have to say that the quality of the sushi is some of the worst that I have had. Fish did not taste fresh, poor sake selection, and the rolls were terrible. I'm guessing the only thing to eat in this restaurant is the teppan style cooking.. I haven't tried it yet, but you have to try REALLY hard to screw that up. I wouldn't bother with this establishment when there are so many other great restaurants in Vegas. I'll save my tepanyaki cravings for when I'm back in good ol' Miami.","I was in Vegas for a Bachelorette party with a group of fifteen girls and we were all in the mood for meat so we decided to have teppan for dinner and hit up Hamada's Asiana since we were already staying at the Rio. We called in to make reservations to sit at the teppanyaki table and they replied back with how it might be hard to accommodate such a large group since our reservation was so last minute and the place might be busy.\n\nOnce we all got dolled up for the night; we were on our way downstairs to the restaurant which appeared \"empty\" for a Saturday night (and they were giving us problems???) The Host sat us down, gave us menus, and that was the end of it. We had to wait awhile until someone finally came and asked us if we had ordered yet. After we ordered, we had a drink or two or three or four; and it took an even longer time for the chef to come with his grill cart (pretty close to thirty minutes). Seriously! How long does it take to round up some beef, chicken, and shrimp for fifteen girls when the restaurant is empty?!\n\nAnd considering that we were here for a Bachelorette Party - imagine how rowdy we were since we were close to being drunk. Our chef on the other hand,was the opposite. Not entertaining, not talkative, not pleasant at all, he pretty much just cooked our food, made it into cute shapes on the teppanyaki table, served us and left. Overall, a boring experience - well at least we had fun afterwards at Chippendales."]}

I don't think that the Royal Buffet will supplant the China King down the street, as the Royal Buffet is smaller (a lot smaller, actually), but it definitely can serve a purpose - mostly because it is a well-tended buffet, and unlike the China King, you get fresh sushi rather than the mass-market variety from the China King.\n\nThe selection on the buffet itself isn't outstanding, and nothing really sets it apart from any other buffet (if in the area and looking for a buffet, I'd probably go to the Dragon House on Woodlawn), but it's not bad, and it does appear to be kept fresh - or at least it was during the time that we were there.\n\nMost of the dishes are pretty standard meat and vegetable variety, and service is good.","This Chinese buffet opened in what used to be the Derby Diner, in the Costco shopping center on Tyvola. It's barely a mile from the long-standing \"Super Buffet\" a little further west, so I'm not sure why there is a need for two so close to each other.\n\nThe Royal Buffet has the usual standard chicken beef and pork dishses on the steam table. It seemed like they were a little lacking during my visit - the chicken teriyaki tasted like simple grilled chicken. Aside from being well charred, it had no flavor. The chicken and brocolli was drowning in sauce. Something labeled \"pork chop\" was large slices of, I assume, pork mixed with vegetables. The highlight of the tables was the full size ribs, which were meaty and delicious.\n\nThere is also a separate area for sushi. Most of the time, the sushi at a Chinese buffet is sort of an after thought. Not so here. This is a mini-sushi bar with several different rolls and salmon, shrimp, crab stick and other nigiris. There is also a sign posted that they will make several different sushi items to order at no extra charge. I made two visits for these fresh rolls and was stuffed.\n\nMy glass of water was refilled often. The restaurant looked clean and the staff checked the condition of the buffet table on a regular basis.\n\nOverall, I was pleased with the Royal Buffet. I would recommend the sushi more - for $12 including soda and tip, a pretty good deal."]}

Anything would have been better than the pizza we received.  It's hard to screw up pizza, so the one star is awarded for accomplishing just that.   The pizza was laden with unevenly melted blobs of the worst mozzarella I've ever tasted, the sauce was bland, the crust lackluster, the toppings depressing.  No one should have to suffer this pizza.  I would advise them to shut down and stop desecrating the pizza world with this slop.","We ordered from Aprimo's because we had a coupon. We probably won't be ordering again. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't great either. We ordered wings and a hoagie. However, it's not really the food that left us wanting more, it was the service. When we called to place the order, the employee seemed like he was in ten different places at once. Very spacey. After telling him what we wanted, he responded with \"Okay. That'll be $25 and will be there in 40 minutes.\" He didn't even ask us how we were paying. Since we wanted to pay with a card, we called right back to give them the card information. The employee once again seemed like he had no clue what was going on and thought we were calling to add on to the order. He didn't understand we just needed to give the card information. It was pretty frustrating. If the food would have been out of this world I would have excused it, but it was really just average. 20 wings and a half hoagie was $25."]}

Then Jose opines, \"oh man they have a salsitas here!\"\nSo I jam on the e-brake and spin my 96 hyundai accent into a tailspin 180 degrees and jam on the pedal whipping it into the Salsitas parking lot.\nWe climb out of the egg shaped vehicle and i slide across the hood dukes of hazard style and we trot into the joint.\nStraight up authentico feel to the place, not a whitey around and just some really smelly (in a good way) grub sizzling away, there is a sneeze guard but behind it you can see all the various types of meats they offer, from Carnitas to Pastor, I was in hog heaven. \nWe order two burritos de pastor, I get mine w/ guac, pico, and refriend pintos free of charge. \nAs we waited we sipped on horchata poured from a huge bucket, and labour over the salsa bar picking and choosing our condiments. The salsa bar is really, probably my favorite part. I always get some sliced raddish, pickled carrot, shredded cabbage, lime, salsa verde, and a few sliced cucumbers to supplement my already hulking burro.\nBy the time we're done w/ the salsa bar, our burritos are finished and off we speed back to work. \nAs I'm typing this my fingers smell of garlic and spiced pork meat, my stomach is full, and my eyelids heavy. \nAlthough the remainder of my day is hard to accomplish after my trips to salsitas I always leave satisfied.

Growing up in San Diego, I grew up with some of the best tasting food around.  When I moved here I was unimpressed over and over again with the places I kept trying around the west valley and even the east valley.  At one point, I even swore off trying any new Mexican style restaurant altogether.  No more gross, greasy, no flavor Mexican food for me!  The Sonoran style food here just doesn't jive with me and my taste for flavorful Baja style food.  Yep, that's right...there's a difference.  Baja style is tastier with a lot more flavor per bite.  I have found that Sonoran is more bland and greasier.\n\nI was pretty skeptical when we walked into Jalapenos (Tio Freddy's).  But then I picked up their menu and saw they had Carne Asada Fries...a San Diego favorite!  Forget everything else on the menu, that is what I ordered.  It was delicious!  Not only was the food flavorful but Tio Freddy and his wife were amazing.  Even though it is a place where you order at the counter, they brought me my food, offered me sauce from the sauce bar, and came by more than once to check on how I was enjoying my food!  \n\nIt is a small place in a strip mall and I have never noticed it before, and I know others haven't.  If you want to try some great Mexican food at a really inexpensive price...try it out!","To think this place has been hiding around the corner from my shop for around 3 years.  I seldom go South and West from work but last week I was headed that way for lunch and spotted this place (Yelp has made me much better at seeing restaurants) and thought \"strip mall Mexican, need to check this out\".  \n\nThe place is brightly colored and clean.  The owner was bustling taking orders and serving tables.  It is set up as counter service only but the owner brings out plates and salsas when he has time anyway.  Interesting to note that all the regulars bussed their own tables and took the plates back to the counter, so I did too.  There are only 6 tables in there, each having 4 seats.  There is enough floor space to reconfigure a couple to make a long one.  If you get there during a rush there can be a bit of a wait for food as they is only a small kitchen.\n\nThe food was excellent.  I had carne asada fries and a fish taco.  I have not had many fish tacos but with Carrie's description of Baja style Mexican I figured it was a safe bet.  It was the best fish taco I have yet to have.  Lightly battered fish fillet on a soft corn tortilla with Pico de Gallo, lettuce and a bit of cilantro which I tasted before I saw or it would have been picked out.  The carne asada fries are a plate of fries covered over in marinated beef and then covered with guacamole, sour cream and shredded cheese.  I would describe the fries as fully cooked but not left in long enough to crisp up the outside, I would consider that limp as a stand alone fry but for this dish it works well.  I also had a medium orchata.  The food is served up without much seasoning, leaving the customer to modify it as he/she deems from the salsa bar.  I chose to leave my alone and was rewarded with food tastes that did not require hiding to make the meal.  There was no grease anywhere to be found.\n\nThis is definitely a place to try if you are in the area and want something a bit different than a 'bertos."]}

If you are aware of the concept of Come Dine With Me, you will know this defeats the purpose. But she was a little dumb and immediately told us she had ordered the food where as I would have been sly and passed it off as my own. She probably would have won if she hadn't admitted to us she hadn't cooked because the food was that good.\n\nI love the concept of I Eat Naked, with the double meaning in the name as all the food is free from additives and completely natural. I learned this after checking up on the website after our dinner party. The meat eaters at the party had steak which was cooked to perfection and the chips... oh the chips! They were carbohydrate goodness, fluffy and crispy at the same time. The veggie had a vegetable and goats cheese dish which she polished off with delight.\n\nThe great thing about this place was the fact it was a takeaway serving top quality, fresh food as opposed to greasy, unexciting food.

Oof...it was another bathroom run soon after.","The environment is a lot nicer than it was previously...no complaints other than the fruit flies around the open ketchup dispenser...tht was kinda nasty...\n\nThis McDonald's has a very nice updated decor. I like how the furniture and the tables appear to come from IKEA.  They now have Bar style seating with large red cushions that are smooth and made of some kind of leather like material. The wall tiles are very large giving the dining area a feeling of openness. \n\nMy favorite thing about this McDonald's is that the menu is on large LCD TV screens as opposed to a chart. The picture quality is really clear and bright and the options are easy to read as opposed to before when they were dimly lit. The parking lot is a lot more open too giving you a chance to maneuver around cars that are backing out or waiting in the drive through line. This McDonald's is definitely an upgrade from the one that was there before. it's no longer on a sharp hill but everything around the restaurant is generally flat so that makes for a nice smooth trip going through the drive-through."]}

Since I no longer work Uptown, I always stop in here after a doctor's appointment.  After fasting all night and into the morning, I am prime for some hot coffee and a great sandwich (sausage, egg \u0026 cheese mcmuffin)!  Service is always excellent and the store typically has a pretty good rating.  I understand (at least previously) staff members received a bonus every time they etched out a 100 or better.  That shows pride in your work.  \n\nNOTE:  This location is open until 7 pm on Fridays.","Ever since I was a kid I've always loved McDonalds. I can't really put my finger on it but I'm sure it has something to do with Ronald McDonald and the happy meals. I'm not going to review the food at this location, because lets just face it we all know what McDonalds taste like. What I will review is the service, location and general overview of the restaurant. \n\nService: These cashiers are hard workers you will see the same smiling face day after day when you come by and order your usual and trust me there are \"regulars\" at this location. Often times I'll be waiting for my order and someone will step up to the line and even before they open their mouth the cashier will say #5 with large sweet tea. The customer will simply nod their head. These cashiers know their customers. The managers here are also  very pleasant. This McDonalds has less of a turnover rate then some of the companies I know. I only have one cashier I try to avoid because she just always seems to have a bad attitude. \n\n\nLocation: Overstreet Mall, Uptown Charlotte.  This is one of the busiest lunch areas in Charlotte. From about 11:45-1:30pm you have thousands of people walk-running like herds of cattle through over street. When I say walk-run it's really just that! They don't walk and they don't run it's like a very fast pace walk, which almost feels like if you get in the way they are going to run you over. It takes some time to get used to once you start working uptown. Oh and heaven forbid you're a slow walker... you'll get some pretty mean stares to the back of your head.\n\nGeneral Overview: They actually just remodeled this location last year so it looks so much better. It's much cleaner and the seating is a lot nicer. At other McDonalds you don't have to wait very long before getting your food and at this one it's about the same, but because of the mass amount of food they have to push out they have a system. There are two separate lines. You have a line to order your food and then a separate line to pick up your order. Try not to get confused because it can be very confusing to newbies and throws us regulars off."]}

We went early Sunday, about 5pm and were the only patrons in the place. There are two doors to enter-the first gets you into a vestibule which, sadly, set the tone for our experience. There was some construction related materials (bucket and cords) just laying there! Really! Why would you leave those there? We were taken to a window seat with a view of the parking lot in one direction and behind us a hallway to the kitchen with a trash can and a vacuum cleaner sitting there in full view. Wall, table and room decor is non-existent. Do they just not see what their customers are seeing?\n\nWe ordered the chicken breast and waffle and enjoyed both. The chicken was nicely seasoned, nice and crisp on the outside and moist on the inside, not at all greasy, and was a good sized portion. The waffle was good too. Our side of greens was okay-not much flavor and floating in a lot of water.\n\nThe service was very attentive, and our server showed us around the rest of the restaurant where they have a bar and showroom-they bring in comedians, musicians and a DJ on selected nights. It looks to have a great layout for shows.\n\nWhen I have guests in my home for dinner, the very least I do is clean up! Julie's ought top do the same, and while they are at it, add a little decor to make the experience more inviting."]}

I think this service would be great for vegans who were staying on the strip and had a microwave and fridge/freezer in their room.  Or anyone really.  Eating out healthy in Vegas isn't necessarily an easy thing, especially for vegans and vegetarians who are visiting! This food is tasty and filling without having the overbearing fat and salt of restaurant food.\n\nMy dishes took about 10 min to heat up in my home and work microwaves except for the lasagna which took about 30 min in my oven.  I really liked everything except for the lasagna; it was very filling but pretty bland, overwhelmed by whole wheat noodles.  The peanut noodles were delish - probably my fave- but the mac n cheez was damn good too.  I would order the noodles, mac, curry, and dumplings again for sure! \n\nThe ginger pear bread was perfect- great banana bread-like texture, just sweet enough, with delicious chunks of pear! My dog agreed with me, as she stole half of it off my kitchen table! (and yes, I ate the rest, it was that good.)\n\nThey are now offering Holiday baskets that sound like a great deal: bread, cupcakes, cookies, and candy (hello, vegan peanut butter cups!!) for only $25.  Someone on my holiday list is definitely getting one of these, and I might have to get one for myself.\n\nI highly recommend trying them out! There is a $5 delivery charge, so I would suggest ordering lots of stuff to make it worth your while.  They keep in the freezer for over a month, so you'll have time to use it up.  Great for folks who are looking to eat healthy (especially lower sodium!)."]}

Dabei lege ich auch viel Wert auf authentisch griechisches Essen, und weniger auf das Ambiente und die Umgebung.Darüber will ich mich beim Delphi auch weniger auslassen: ein Biergarten direkt an der relativ viel befahrenen Grötzinger Straße. Innen eine klassische rustikale Kneipe, mit oftmals voll besetzten Tischen. Die Lage gilt deshalb auch als gut erreichbar  Parkplätze finden sich nicht gerade reichlich, aber entlang der Straßen doch immer irgenwdo. \nDer sehr symptahische  und griechische! -Service passt mir sehr gut. Herzlichkeit, immer für einen Spaß zu haben aber nicht übertrieben. Das gefällt mir. Hier sehe ich gerne darüber hinweg, dass es die immer etwas mürrische griechische Mentalität hier keinen Einzug hält! Die Karte ist typisch für einen deutschen Griechen. Leider finden sich ganz typische Gerichte nicht auf der Karte. Ein Stifado, Gemistas oder ähnliches würde ich mir hier noch wünschen. Allerdings schmeckt dafür alles, was man auf der Karte findet ausgesprochen lecker! Das sind hautpsächlich Fleischgerichte, aber auch Moussaka oder Vorspeisen. Ich habe hier das Gefühl, dass die Produkte noch selbst gemacht sind, und nicht wie bei manch anderen Griechen Käsecreme oder Tzatziki als Fertig-Produkt. So bekommt man hier z.B. auch das Weinblatt warm serviert  ein Gedicht! Auch das Moussaka ist zu empfehlen  schmeckt wie zu Hause Leider gibt es den Beilagensalat wie so oft mit einer weißen cremigen Soße, und nicht nackt wie in Griecheland üblich. Scheinbar verlangt das der Deutsche Gast so  wobei ich noch nie versucht habe, umzubestellen, das muss ich mir für meinen nächsten Besuch merken. Auch eher deutsche Sitte ist wohl, dass sowohl vor als auch nach dem Essen ein Ouzo serviert wird. Aber in Ordnung geht das natürlich ;-) \nFür mich ist das Delphi einer der wirklich empfehlenswerten Griechen in Karlsruhe, und ich werde sicherlich wieder hingehen."]}

Man hatte das Gefühl, dass sie nur noch auf den Feierabend warteten. \nDas Essen war für die doch recht günstigen Preise ansprechend und qualitativ in Ordnung. \nDennoch kann ich meinen Vorrednern nur bedingt beipflichten, denn der Gesamteindruck des Lokals lässt bei mir nicht mehr als 3 solide Sterne zu. \nFür einen spontanen Besuch ohne zu große Erwartungen, kann ich es aber empfehlen."]}

Ich war mit 2 Arbeitskollegen dort, wir alle waren unzufrieden.\n\n\n Die Lokalität: Die Einrichtung wirkt eher alt und kitschig, dort sollte mal renoviert werden. Komischerweise war der Laden dennoch recht voll, ich kann mir nicht erklären warum.\n\n\n Der Service: Unfreundlich und lange Wartezeiten! Der Kellner wirkte fast schon als wäre er sich zu schade uns zu bedienen. Höflichkeit war auch nicht zu spüren, nichtmal einen schönen Abend hat man uns nach dem bezahlen gewünscht. Mag daran gelegen haben, dass wir am Trinkgeld geknausert haben aber das gibts nunmal nur für guten Service...\n\n\n Die Speisen: Geschmack war eher fade, macht satt, mehr auch nicht. Die Portionsgröße war jedoch eine Frechheit, einer meiner Kollgegen hatte eine Lasagne, die in den bekannten Lasagneschalen gereicht wurde. Ich habe jedoch zum ersten mal gesehen, dass diese höchstens zur Hälfte gefüllt wird. Satt wird man davon also bestimmt nicht.\n\n\n Die Preise: Teuer. Ein Weizenbier mit 0,5L kostet fast 4EUR, eine \"übersichtlich\" portionierte Standardpizza mit fadem Geschmack liegt bei 8EUR.\n\n\n Fazit: Mir fällt leider kein positiver Punkt zu dem Laden ein. Einfach meiden.","Ich war mit 11 Kollegen im Il Teatro essen und nicht besonders angetan. Für einen Montag Abend war es erstaunlich voll, es waren gegen 20 Uhr fast alle Tische besetzt. Nett, dass wir ohne Vorbestellung (!) noch einen Tisch bekommen haben. Ähnlich wie von den Vorrezensenten beschrieben hatten wir aber eher das Gefühl zu stören. Zudem vergaß die Bedienung einen Kollegen bei der Bestellung der Getränke UND der Speisen. Kann bei 11 Leuten ja mal passieren \nSowohl Speisen als auch Getränke kamen recht zügig, dafür gibt es einen Stern. \nVon der Qualität war ich angesichts der defitigen Preise dann aber doch enttäuscht. Ein vorab bestelltes Pizzabrot war teils verbrannt. Die Penne mit Kalbsstreifen schwammen in einer völlig verwässerten, dünnen Tomatensauce und waren geschmacklich total langweilig (schade ums Fleisch), nur am Salz wurde nicht gespart. Für die ordentliche Portion gibt`s den zweiten Punkt. Gefüllte, frische Pasta oder wenigstens ein Ziegenkäse o.ä. on top wären prima gewesen.\nInsgesamt wirkten alle Speisen lieblos, der gemischte Salat mit Putenstreifen der Kollegin war auch eher 0815 (obligatorischer Schnittsalat mit Tomaten und einem Löffelchen geraspelten Möhren und Kidneybohnen), dafür aber ebenfalls reichlich. Die Kollegen mit der Pizza waren ganz zufrieden, wenngleich der Belag für mein Empfinden nicht besonders üppig war (vegetarische Pizza nur mit Artischocken, Zwiebeln und Oliven zu belegen, finde ich ein bisschen langweilig). \nAlles in Allem war es ok, aber eben nur ok und angesichst der Preise definitiv überteuert. Da gehen nicht mehr als 2 Sterne. Ein teueres Hauptgericht von der Fleisch- oder Fischkarte würde ich gar nicht erst wagen zu bestellen  aber vielleicht sind die ja besser. Bleibt die Frage, ob es an der exponierten Lage liegt, dass das Restaurant oft so voll ist?\nVielleicht kann mir ja jmd. einen besseren Italiener in der der karlsruher Innenstadt für den nächsten Besuch empfehlen."]}

Lediglich der typisch chinesische Duft lässt etwas erahnen. Deshalb habe ich es auch erst bei meinem zweiten Besuch in der Gegend geschafft, es mal auszuprobieren.\n\nAus chinesischen Foren wurde mir gesagt, dass es hier authentisches chinesisches Essen gäbe. Beim Eintreten fiel der Blick aber erstmal auf die \"Döner-Style\" Leuchttafel mit den typischen gebratenen Nudeln mit xy und den diversen Huhn-, Rind- und Entengerichten. Doch dann fanden wir unten rechts auf der Scheibe der Theke den versteckten Zettel mit den \"echten\" chinesischen Gerichten auf Chinesisch. Vielversprechend! Wir entschieden uns für Ma Pu Dou Fu (scharfer Tofu mit Hackfleischsoße) und Yu Xiang Rou Si (Gemüse und Fleischstreifen in einer typischen Fischduft-Soße). \n\nAm Tisch sitzend fiel auf, daß das Restaurant ziemlich viele Tische hat, was man von außen nicht so sieht. Die großen Fenster machen es recht hell, und die offene Tür zur Nebenstraße hat für frische Luft gesorgt, alles ganz angenehm. Natürlich ist das hier kein Sternerestaurant, sondern einfach ein solides kleines chinesisches Restaurant. \n\nDas Essen war reichlich, frisch, und gut. Es schmeckte wirklich nach China, sehr authentisch (man bedenke, daß es auch für diese zwei Gerichte Hunderte Zubereitungsmöglichkeiten gibt, die alle als \"original\" gelten dürften, je nachdem aus welcher Provinz der Koch stammt). Für meinen Geschmack, geprägt durch Zhejiang, Jiangsu und Peking gab es da nichts zu meckern, lecker. \n\nFazit: Mein Tipp, wenn man entweder Heimweh/Fernweh hat, oder einfach mal was \"echtes\" chinesisches ausprobieren möchte."]}

Ich habe mich für die Spezialitäten entschieden und dort das Risotto mit Krabben, Brandy und scharfer Tomatensoße gewählt. Das man bei Risotto immer ein bisschen länger warten darf (zum Glück, sonst kommt es sonst wo her), konnte ich mein Pseudo Weissbier geniesen. Nach ca. 15-20 Min kam auch das Rissotto  wirklich sehr kreativ in Form eines Herzes und einer Blume aus Tomate und Zucchini dekoriert. Die eigens georderte Pfeffermühle war defekt, wobei auch nicht wirklich notwendig. Der Risotto hatte die richtige Suppigkeit sowie noch ein klein wenig Biss  perfekt. Der Chef hat mich dann noch aufgeklärt, dass die MAMA heute auch für Ihn den Risotto gekocht hat, der er auf Diät ist. Irgendwie sympatisch. Die Mama hat sich dann auch noch nach meinem Befinden erkundigt, so dass es dann reif für einen Prosecco Krappa war, der jedoch eine größere Lücke im mein Budget gerissen hat. Da hätte ich auch noch eine Pizza essen können.

Deshalb war ich natürlich auch gleich kurz nach der Eröffnung im Noodelz. Aber ich muss sagen, es war eine Enttäuschung.\n\n\n Ich hatte Penne mit Bolognese-Soße und das in der großen Big Box-Portion. Die Box war zwar vollgefüllt, aber das fast nur mit Nudeln. Es war viel zu wenig Sosse darüber. Geschmacklich war es Mittelmaß.\n\n\n Für ein Mittag-Essen halte ich persönlich auch den Inhalt der sogenannten Big Box für viel zu gering. Ich hatte jedenfalls schon Nachmittags wieder richtig Hunger. Und ich esse normalerweise keine Riesen-Portionen.\n\n\n Getränke gibt es nur in 0,5 Liter PET-Flaschen für die man Pfand bezahlen muss. Zumindest als ich dort war, wollte man keine Flaschen zurücknehmen und meinte, ich sollte sie doch woandes abgeben um mein Pfand zurückzuerhalten. Hätte ich auf mein Pfand verzichtet, hätte ich die Flasche natürlich da lassen können. Hoffentlich hat sich das mittlerweile geändert.","so, jetzt geb ich auch mal meine Nudel ab: \nich kann bisher nur den Lieferservice beurteilen, im Restaurant selbst war ich noch nicht.\n\n\n Bestellt werden kann bisher telefonisch, einmal hatten wir es versucht und niemanden erreicht. \nSonderbar, aber beim nächsten Mal war'S wieder problemlos möglich.\n\n\n Eine Bestellung für mehrere Leute fällt bei Noodelz immer etwas komplizierter aus: groß/klein, als Menü, welche Nudeln, welche Soße, welche Salatsoße...\naber: wer die Wahl hat hat die Qual, und dann eben auch die lange Bestellung.\n\n\n Die Vollkornnudeln begrüße ich herzlich! \nIch finde die Auswahl der Soßen könnte auch gerne noch aufgestockt werden. Etwas mehr Gemüse würde ich da begrüßen (wie z.B. im Juni-Spezial)\nLeider gibt's bei der Getränkeauswahl zum Menü nur die üblichen Süßpamp-Getränke oder \"Bonaqua\" - sorry, Tafelwasser lass ich mir lieber aus dem \"Hahne\".\nFairtrade-Kaffee im Programm ist lobenswert, für Besteller aber nicht wirklich praktikabel.\n\n\n I.d.R. kam aber alles richtig an, einmal wurder der Salat vergessen (und dafür nächstemal ausgeglichen)- das nächste Mal fehlte ein ganzes Essen, (dafür gibts jetzt einen Stern abgzug!) und der Rihkostsalat ist nur grün.\n\n\n Vom Essen selbst bin ich nicht derart begeistert wie meine Vorgänger. Die Nudeln sind selbst beim Bringservice auf den Punkt gekocht, das ist Prima. \nDie Soßen sind geschmacklich einwandfrei, die Pesto sogar sehr gut. \nLeider hatte ich letztemal lediglich einen halben Telelöffel davon über meinen Nudeln- etwas mehr hätte nicht geschadet. \nEnttäuscht bin ich vom Salat: der gemische Salat bestand lediglich aus grünem Salat und Radicchio-Blättern (war das ein Versehen?) war aber dafür firsch. \nDie Salat-Soße kommt in der Tüte von Thomy (oder einem anderen Fertigsoßenmischer).\nBeim Salat besteht also m.E. noch Verbesserungsbedarf.\n\n\n Tja, der Verpackungsmüll ist auch so eine Sache. Immerhin werden die Nudeln in der Papierbox geliefert... schöner wäre natürlich Kai's Methode nachzuahmen, und gänzlich ohne den Müll auszukommen, aber das ist vielleicht DOCH etwas viel verlangt. \nBeim \"Chinesen\" moniere ich das ja auch nicht.\n\n\n Die Preise sind in Ordnung.\n\n\n Fazit: für täglich zu wenig Auswahl, aber sonst: gute Idee mit Geschmack, die nocht verbesert werden kann- und das Potential zum 5 Sterne-Kandidaten hat."]}

Alles frisch gekocht, als hätte tatsächlich eine griechische Mama gekocht. Man schmeckt und sieht den Unterschied: die Salate kommen nicht aus dem Eimer, die Pommes nicht aus der TK-Packung. Und über dem Preis kann man nicht meckern. Die Einrichtung ist nicht jedermanns Sache, aber alles macht einen sauberen und gepflegten Eindruck. Ich würde das Lokal auf jedem Fall weiter empfehlen.","Aufgrund der beiden so unterschiedlichen bisherigen Beiträge dachte ich, ich probiere das mal selbst aus und mache mir ein Bild- zu Mal es griechisch ist, und die Lage gut für mich erreichbar - nämlich innenstadt-nah.\n\n\n Scheinbar wurde innen gerade erst frisch renoviert, so habe ich es auf der Homepage gelesen. Es sieht auch neu aus, allerding ist die lachs-aprikosenfarbene Wand nicht gerade mein Geschmack. Der für griechische Restaurants typische Kitsch fehlt - es ist eher romantisch-modern gehalten. Von Umgebung und Atmosphäre nicht unbedingt meins, aber auch nicht zu tadeln. Das Restaurant war etwa halb gefüllt, was eigentlich angenehm war.\n\n\n Die Servicekraft war sehr freundlich und aufmerksam. Auch hier fand ich nichts zu bemängeln.\n\n\n Salat gibt es als Beilage bzw. vorneweg fast zu jedem Gericht. Wie so oft in Deutschland leider nicht die griechische Art, sondern eben Deutsch - Eisberg mit Karottenstreifen etc. und Joghurt-Dressing. Griechisch wäre mir lieber, beim Griechen. \nDas von mir bestellte Ofen-Lamm-Gericht hat mich ähnlich enttäuscht. Es war durchaus essbar, das Fleisch war zart - aber mich ließ der Verdacht nicht los, dass es nicht in diesem Restaurant gekocht wurde. Zumindest hat das Lamm nicht in der Sauße gekocht, in der es serviert wurde. Insgesamt eher fad. Das gegrillte Fleisch (auch Lamm) hingegen war perfekt.\n\n\n Die vom Vorredner gelobten Kartoffelchips fand ich auch gut. Allerdings kenne ich die aus preislich wesentlich günstigeren Lokalitäten in Karlsruhe unter dem Namen \"Bratkartoffeln\", was die Vermutung zuläßt, dass auch hier nicht viel Arbeit drinsteckt. (aber immerhin eine gute Auswahl). \nAuch das Tsatiki ist gut.\n\n\n Auf der Karte befinden sich außer griechischen Grill + Ofengerichten auch Rumpsteaks und Schnitzel, wie auch Fischgerichte. Leider fehlten mir hier die typisch griechischen Gerichte wie Moussaka, Gemistas, Tintenfisch etc.\n\n\n Fazit: direkt nach dem Besuch ging meine Tendenz sogar Richtung zwei Sterne - wegen des guten gegrillten Lammes und weil der Beitrag des ersten Schreibers dann vielleicht doch etwas überzogen ist- schwenke ich nun auf drei.\nEs gibt eindeutig bessere \"Griechen\" in Karlsruhe."]}

The front of the restaurant has smaller tables which looked like a nice area to get drinks and appetizers while there is a full restaurant in the lower level.  We sat down and informed the waiter that we were just interested in wine and a light bite and would not be ordering a full dinner.  He literally sulked and told us we must order a full meal.  We thought he was joking and informed him we would love to try a full meal another night, but that we were not hungry enough right now.  He then asked us to leave.  Seriously?!?  At this point it became obvious he was not joking and so we left.  \n\nHow is the food?  No idea, as we could not get past Cerberus the waiter from the underworld, but while we were waiting, we were given prepackaged \"italian\" breadsticks.  A good restaurant would provide fresh bread IMHO!!\n\nThere are much better choices in the area.","The Patio Restaurant is definitely not the best restaurant in Edinburgh. It doesn't look much on the outside, and to be honest, it is isn't up to much inside either. Situated in Hanover Street, The Patio Restaurant is in the heart of the New Town area of Edinburgh and so it should be hot spot for people going for lunch and dinner, but its not - because it is awful!\n\nThe inside of The Patio Restaurant is really drab and dull and could definitely do with a revamp. I came here for lunch one day and I was really disappointed with my whole experience. This is an Italian restaurant, serving pizzas and pastas, but not that well. I ordered a peperoni pizza which hardly had any topping or cheese, and it was literally dripping in grease - it is something which I would only normally eat on my way home for a night out, not for a nice lunch. The prices were very reasonable here though, with most main courses costing under six pounds. The staff were friendly enough and the portion sizes were fairly decent. \n\nThere are much better Italian restaurants in Edinburgh which are more deserving of your custom."]}

Sadly, it scored a huge thumbs down, it had none of the fresh airy just-whipped today texture, it was heavy on the rum, disgustingly heavy on the sugar, and the four of us together could not muster up the wits to eat it all. It was a tiramisu gone wrong, a thick, unappealing glob of sickly sweet cream and to top of, a squirting of what I suspect was hershey's chocolate syrup on the plate, and bad chocolate shavings on top.

It was a lot sweeter, and even had a watermelon after taste.  It is also a lot lighter on the cream.  \n\nThe appetizer I ordered wasn't great, but it was edible.  Basically, it was a little fried patty with shrimp, pork, chicken, ground up with a corn.  It was deep fried in a nice tasting batter.  The shrimp/chicken/pork mixture wasn't the best, but it did come with a nice, sweet homemade sauce.  It was actually quite good with the curry that I had.\n\nThe yellow curry was plentiful, just like the old Essence of Thai, served in a large bowl.  It was a pretty basic, standard yellow curry with potatoes and chopped carrots.  The curry was soupy, but not as soupy as my favorite styles of curry.  It wasn't sweet at all, although the curry taste was a little bit on the bland side.  Still good though, and better than the places that dump a bunch of sugar into their coconut-based curries.  \n\nUnfortunately, I never had the yellow curry at Essence of Thai, so I can't compare it to the old place.  Next time I will try either the Khao Soi, or the roast duck curry, both of which were really good at the old Essence of Thai.

The next person behind the counter topped the meat with toppings of my choice - pico de gallo, corn, cilantro - and gave me a cup for my drink.\n\nThey have a separate area with toppings, corn, salsa, hot sauce, mild sauce, jalapenos and olives.

They really should double the tortillas for tacos.  The beef was lukewarm, the toppings cold and wasn't very flavorful.

It has a bit of a rustic interior and has an almost cabin-ey feeling to it with it's wooden floors, photographs of local sunsets and a mix-and-match arrangement of wooden chairs and tables.  \n\nThere is a wide variety of dishes on the menu. We had a coupon that allowed two starters and two mains, plus two glasses of champagne for £24.95.  The regular prices for most dishes are reasonable (£9.95 for fresh haddock and chips.  I saw one of the plates and it was a massive portion!).  \n\nI had a pesto tortellini with tomatoes, red onion and black olives as my starter.  Starters range in price from about £3.95 to £6.95 and are a taste-tester size to get your palate warmed up for the main.  My partner had a starter-portion of haggis, neeps and tatties with a mustard-whisky sauce.  I must admit that my starter was nothing to write home about. It sounds a lot nicer on the menu than it actually tasted, with the pasta being way over-cooked and not much flavour in the pasta itself. Most of the dish's flavour came from the tomatoes, onions and black olives that were mixed in with about 5 tortellini shells.  I would not recommend that particular starter in future but there were plenty of other things to choose from including a smoked duck Waldorf salad, king prawns with mango and marie rose sauce; and nachos.  I tried a bit of the haggis starter. It was much nicer than mine but expect more neeps and tatties than haggis, and a miniature version of it.\n\nFor mains there is a wide selection from seafood, burgers, chicken dishes and several different types of steak. Since we wanted to make the most of our coupon, we both opted for the 8 oz fillet steak with garlic butter (blue cheese and pepper sauces are also options), chips, mushrooms, onion and tomato (regular £17.95).  I was expecting the steak with a few bits of the garnish and maybe a stack of 8 chips.  I was pleasantly surprised to find a good bowl-sized portion of chips, big mushrooms, lots of onion and half a tomato.  The steak was perfectly cooked and as a whole the meal was delicious! I highly recommend this restaurant on the basis of its reasonable prices and the steak dinner alone.  It was also noted on one of their chalkboards that Tuesday is steak night where you get two steak dinners and a bottle of wine for £25.  They also seem to have a variety of theme nights including an African Safari featuring exotic meats such as Ostrich, Kudu, Antelope and Zebra between March 25 and 27th.\n\nOverall this place is worth a visit if you are looking for something quaint just outside Edinburgh! It's easily accessible from the city centre on buses 26 or 44 (and potentially more than that!).\n\nI am still dreaming about that steak..."]}

There is a pretty big salad bar at this location, and the food changes based on the time of day.\n\nOne thing that I love about this particular location is the speed at which they attack take-out orders.  Again never a more than a 20 minute wait.  They also have fresh bakery items in the case, which I love since not all E'NP's bother with that.  Make sure you get a Smiley Cookie before you leave...Or a dozen.","A Pittsburgh staple.  They're so family-friendly, their mascot (see, they have a mascot - totally family friendly) is a smiling cookie.\n\nMost recently, I was here for brunch after church, though I've been coming here for years.  The servers are always friendly, it's usually pretty clean, and the buffet is normally well-stocked.  I love their new, health-conscious approach to their menu; they still have the classics, like the breakfast smile with full fat and grease or the smart breakfast smile, with less fat and grease.  Fresh fruit instead of bacon was actually a refreshing change (and I love me some bacon) and my egg-beater-like egg white substitute really did taste good and egg-y.  My father had the same thing, but the original version.  Those hashbrowns they have are like fried gold - always the first thing that gets eaten.\n\nOur server was always quick with the coffee.  Even though she had other tables, she'd take care of us first so as to allow time to chat with her regulars.  I can appreciate that; it makes you want to be a regular.\n\nPros: relatively quick service (it's been faster, but it was Sunday), fresh take on the menu, servers take care of the regulars\nCons: this time the food delivery was really lagging (no fault of the server, the kitchen must have been slammed), booths weren't fully clean before we sat down"]}

TOTALLY worth it, if you ask me. For $2, you get a full chicken breast sliced over your salad instead of just a couple of strips. \n\nTip: I've noticed that you get more bang for your buck if you order 'for here' instead of 'to go', which probably has something to do with the size of the plate (huge! and without a lid!) versus the size of the take-out container (smaller! with a lid!). So, if you are extra hungry and have some extra time, I'd suggest you ordering your salad (with added chicken) 'for here'! :)"]}

Neither of us had been there before so we decided to check it out.  The bar was about halfway full and not too loud.  \n\nI decided to get the pork chop.  It was ok, but I have definitely had better food. It was little too dry for me.\n\nThe service was pleasant and a change from the usual that is seen on saint laurent.","We really gave this place a chance but it just failed in so many ways. \n\nFirst off, I don't know if the guy in charge of house sound is deaf or what but the music was so loud that we were straining our voices trying to talk (yell) to each other. Then the Canadiens game began and it was even louder. For a place trying to serve fancy looking food, the ambiance just sucked because of the noise. It was not a busy night, so I'm not sure why they thought they had to deafen their patrons.\n\nThe menu was simple enough but unfortunately so was the waitress. This waitress was just not all there.  She was pleasant, easy on the eyes but that's about it. She took our drink orders, upsold us to the larger portion of salmon tartar and forgot to take our dinner order.\n \nWhen she came back with the drinks 10 minutes later, she spun on her heels to go do something else and we had to almost grab her to get her to take our orders. We ordered the flank (bavette) steak and she seemed to forget to ask how we would like it cooked. My dinner companion took matters into his own hands and actually chased the waitress down across the restaurant to make SURE she knew to put the order in for medium rare. 20 minutes passed, 30 minutes passed. No tartar, no flank steaks.\n\nThen out came the tartar appetizer at the same time as the steaks... The tartar wasn't particularly inspired, little flavour and served with 6 french fries. We dug into the steaks and, wouldn't you know it, they were well done to the point of being the tenderness of shoe leather and as dry as tree bark. 1-2 bites in we cut the middle of the steaks to see if there was any hopeful hint of pink, but no dice. The waitress didn't ask the basic  question of \"is everything ok?\" as we began our meal so we tried to flag down the guy in the dress shirt who seemed to be a manager. He didn't see us (or anyone else for that matter) as he just sat down on the bar and fiddled with his iPhone. \n\nWe finally managed to get a manager and by that time it was too much for us. It was a very unfortunate experience but at least the manager was kind enough to delete the shoe steaks from the bill. As we headed for the door I doubt our waitress had any idea what had transpired. She was cheerful and looked as if she was pleased to see satisfied customers leaving. Alas, that was clearly not not the case -  Factory was a total failure right from front of house to back.\n\nWe left hungry and disappointed, so we went up the street to La Belle Provence to get hot dogs and poutine instead.

I have very mixed feelings about it though. I will start with the positives: It is light, bright and aesthetically pleasing. The ceiling is all glass, the floors are wooden. It is modern, but built into and shares the stone wall of an ancient church. It has views out onto a picturesque churchyard through the back and opens onto a well-kept pleasant garden on the side. You can bring your toddler here to play with lots of toys. You can sit on a sofa in the corner, drink a coffee and nurse your newborn - along with lots of other mothers, babies and children. It is one of the only cafes in town that caters directly to parents-with-small-children. So, it is a place in which you can relax with a cup of coffee and your toddler without eliciting the annoyed glares of other childless customers. Which brings me to what I struggle with here. \n\nIt it is chaotic. And I do not think that it has to be. On my recent visit Friday, for the two hours I spent there, no tables were bused, despite dirty dishes piling up and there seeming to be ample staff around. We never were able to sit in the cozy couch corner as it was never cleared of the leftover dishes and food of previous customers. The toy corner for the children, although very much appreciated, is in dire need of a bit of care - and perhaps replacement. I am more than willing to tolerate the inevitable chaos of small children, but I would like to enjoy a somewhat tidy and clean place to do it in. \n\nThe menu also caters to small things and this is also much appreciated. But the choices for beverages for little ones seemed to be exclusively ribena and sugar supplemented 'juice drinks.' Maybe I just caught them at the end of a busy week, but in looking for a wee snack there appeared to be more than a few items on offer that were pre-packaged sweets - not something I would expect in a cafe. \n\nSo, I am torn here. There is a lot to like about this cafe (and my small child loves it!), but there is some to be desired as well.

Nous avons également reçu un flanc d'agneau cuit sous-vide pendant 48h, qui était tout simplement divin ! Suivirent des côtelettes d'agneau avec des ravioli à la queue de bœuf tellement savoureuse. Comme prédessert, un toast avec un fromage fondu, caramel de canneberge et petite salade de pomme gala d'une simplicité, mais oh combien délicieux.

Bon synchronisme entre les plats. \n\nAmbiance - douillet et humble. Presque campagnarde ! Le bâtiment est une maisonnette charmante avec différentes pièces de décor varié.","Wow. \n\nMy boyfriend and I dined at Le Mitoyen last night, and it was some of the best food we've ever had. Executive chef Richard Bastien is a genius! The flavour combinations were out of this world, and the depth was incredible. \n\nLe Mitoyen is a converted house, built in 1870. There are several separate dining areas, a nice fireplace, artwork on the walls, candles at each table and soft music in the background. Service was excellent - each course was presented with a description of the ingredients.\n\nFor Valentine's day weekend, a prix fixe 7 course menu was offered ($85/each or $140/each with wine pairings) with a choice of one of 4 mains.\n\nWe started with a glass of champagne and the salmon cooked \"sous vide\" - basically vacuum sealed and cooked in an immersion circulator, I believe.  Is was served on a rectangle of watermelon with citrus. The marinade was vodka-based.  SO GOOD! The texture of the salmon was amazing, and nicely complimented the crispness of the watermelon. \n\nWe then had a lobster tail with a mango sauce, microgreens, and tiny cucumber balls. There was a taste we couldn't quite place, and then realized it was vanilla (we think!). Whoa. Vanilla lobster? Who would have thought... ? Delicious! \n\nNext was a white polenta atop moist guinea foul with a rich guinea foul gravy. It was garnished with fried grains, rice and quinoa that turned into a 'rice krispy' texture. Again, awesome. \n\nWe had the foie gras, served with a winter-root puree, carrots and a roast potato and spicy microgreens. I'm not a foie gras fan, but my boyfriend love it. The puree was delicious!  (not included in the prix fixe menu - an extra $17). \n\nAfter that, we had a delicious bouillon,  with finely diced carrots, and something with a bit of kick (couldn't quite place it...).  It is served spoon-less, and meant to be sipped.  \n\nFor the main course, I had the pigeonneau (yup!! domestic pigeon! I'm living on the wild side :P)  with wild mushroom risotto, and what I believe was a kind of liver mousse.  The sauce was flavourful,rich, and delicious, and the risotto was earthy and creamy. The pigeonneau was delicious and tender.  My boyfriend had the lamb, and it was amazing! So tender, and moist. \n\nWe finished with coffee and desserts.   We had an amazing profiterole filled with ricotta and tonka beans, and served with lemon curd. We also had a strawberry soup, with basil ice cream. Oh. My. Yum.  Honestly. Holy Food!!!! \n\nAt the end of our meal we noticed we had missed a course - a cheese based dish.  Our waitress was apologetic, and since we didn't want it after our dessert, we were credited the cost of a glass of champagne.  We were a pretty disappointed to have missed it, since it likely would have been amazing, like everything else.  A bit of a miss given the calibre of the restaurant. But, c'est la vie. \n\nThe service efficient and friendly,  allowing enough distance for a romantic evening but always close enough should anything be needed.\n\nHighly recommend! It's definitely pricey, but you're looking for a splurge, this is the spot."]}

Yes, the place was empty and clean and service was ok, so no faults there. But what really got to me, and the big reason this place is two stars, is the following: when I ordered my asada, the guy pulled a tub of pre-cooked asada meat out and reheated it on the grill. That may be standard practice for fast-food places, but it's not what I expect from taco places. Not at all. I mean, making carne asada is the easiest thing ever: just grill up some flank meat, season it, cut it, put it on a tortilla. It's not like I asked you to bring me a space rock from the crab nebula, ok, so please don't re-heat my meat like you're saving all this time in a complicated process. No. The tacos themselves were ok -- ok in the way that you make yourself a grilled cheese at home and are ok with it. \n\nFlavor-wise, I would not return to this place.

My friend was going to be interviewing the author, Roy Gill, and the illustrator, Paul Mudie, so I popped along to listen (and clap and make appreciative noises). \n\nPulp Fiction is a bookshop specialising in 'genre fiction' - mystery, fantasy, romance, crime, and science fiction novels. It's a gorgeous wee place, with lots of funny signs and a giant inflatable fish that roams around the room. It's not *really* my sort of reading - I like some of this stuff, but most isn't really my thing. That said, I loved the shop, and I know lots of people go there to just hang out and write during the day. \n\nThere's a cafe, too, with sandwiches, coffee and cake. We bought sandwiches to eat before the reading and they were delicious. But... just a warning for anyone a bit fussy or with food intolerances - watch them like a hawk! I ordered a smoked duck and salad roll. Ok, ok, look, I only wanted ham! But they had none, so duck it was. \n\nAnd what I got was a baguette with salad, duck, cheese, raw ginger, berry reduction (aka jam) and vinaigrette. And it was amazing! But.. it wasn't what I ordered. So just, you know, be aware if you order something. And give yourself plenty of time, because all that ginger chopping and jam dripping took about 10 minutes per sandwich. \n\nOch, I really don't want to slag it off - I loved my sandwich and I loved the bookshop. Go there. Just know you're going to get werewolves and ginger, and all will be well.","Is it a book shop? No. Is it a café? No. Is it Pulp Fiction, well yes.\n\nIt's hard to describe Pulp Fiction as anything than what it is. It's a book shop specialising in fiction, and I am guessing especially fantasy and sci-fi fiction. It has a hushed, relaxed and calm atmosphere. I really, really liked the vibe in here. The owner (I assume) of the book shop was genuinely warm and welcoming, but calm. Whilst I was there, some customers came in asking for book recommendations, he asked their tastes, then recommended. It's a specialist book shop.\n\nIt also has a deli café. But not of poor quality. Oh no. Look at the photo I uploaded of the deli platter (for £6). SO MUCH CHEESE. This could have easily fed 2. Three types of salami and ham, 4 types of cheese. The smoked duck sandwich also sounded divine but they had sold out from an event the night before.\n\nAnd the café isn't an afterthought. The majority of the store front has good-sized tables, at least 6 of them. I particularly mention good-sized as when you have a laptop and an epic-sized plate of cheese and meat, you need a lot of space. They also didn't mind that I rocked up and sat for 3 hours, picked at my cheese, typed away on my laptop and didn't buy a book.\n\nThey also host writer's groups, and I believe they hosted the last Dr Sketchy's Anti-Art class.\n\nIt's friendly, it's got a local community neighbourhood feel to it and I imagine if you went enough you'd become a regular, and they'd remember your coffee order and say \"ah I have just the book for you, it just came in last week!\"\n\nI can see myself coming back here. Like Gillian L, the books aren't quite my normal reading (they used to be, Terry Pratchett massive right here) but for those who love fantasy and sci-fi it's a treasure trove."]}

I told her the rest of the meal was eaten by my family and asked which end she wanted it out of!  She said that she would give me a store credit for the biscuits that were missing from my order.

There was hardly anyone there at the time, so it was very calm and quiet.  I could hear the people at the next table speaking German and the head waiter had a strong Italian accent which made the whole experience seem so continental.\n\nThe iced tea came with a lemon wrapped in a yellow net with a green ribbon, so luxurious!

First off, it is a city landmark, it's been around forever and has dated decor, but I find that charming. It's also right on Lake Mendota, so the views are awesome.\n\nThe restaurant we've eaten at is called The Admiralty, the fine dining room. The first time I went was pretty much flawless. I had the duck and it was cooked perfectly. They do a tableside Caesar salad that was recommended to me by a friend and it was one of the best I've had anywhere. The staff was also exceptional. \n\nThe second time was different. The staff was still very courteous and friendly, but the cap came off of one of the bottles of ingredients in the tableside Caesar, spilling way too much of whatever it was on the lettuce, I could DEFINITELY taste the difference, it was very bitter. I should've had him re-do it. He then recommended the Steak Diane to me as one of their specialties. It's a classic recipe you don't see in too many restaurants, so I tried it. I wouldn't recommend it. It is also done tableside, and the steak was cooked perfectly, but the other flavors weren't very desirable and it comes with no sides because it is loaded with roasted veggies. \n\nThe only thing that was good both times was the service and the desserts, tableside flambe's.

The food was made-to-order and was absolutely delicious. Recommended!!","I've been to this place twice now and had a pretty good experience both times.  The first time, about a week ago, I got the basic Chicken and Waffle combo.  The chicken came out piping hot.  Both were delicious.  The only problem I had was five minutes after I got my food and before it had a chance to cool off, a security guard came up to me and told me the food court (and the mall) were closing in 15 minutes, hardly enough time for the food to cool off enough to eat it.  It was a Sunday so they closed early.  I would have enjoyed my food more if I hadn't had to rush.\n\nThe second time was yesterday.  I got the Fish with One Side combo.  The credit card machine must have been out or something, there was a sign saying they could only take cash.  I got collard greens as my side.  The fish was excellent and my grandson loved it too and kept getting bites of it from me.  The tarter sauce tasted homemade.  I wish there had been more than one piece of fish, tho it was pretty big (see photo).  The collard greens had wonderful flavor but were also way too salty for my taste.  The kind of salty that hurts your taste buds.  They were cooked with real ham that gave them their wonderful flavor, don't know if they added salt on top of it or if it was just that salty from the ham.\n\nThe man behind the counter, who is also the cook I think, was very nice, the kind of guy who welcomes you the first time, and more so as a return customer.\n\n I look forward to returning here, both for more chicken and to try other dishes."]}

Der Laden ist nicht sonderlich groß für ein Einrichtungshaus, aber man findet für alle Bereiche etwas. \nDas bleibende Gefühl nach meinem ersten Besuch ist allerdings eher negativ. Zum einen hätte ich mir bei einer Eröffnung ein wenig mehr Party erhofft und hätte gerne eine Wurst gegessen und ein Bier getrunken, zum anderen fand ich mich als Familie nicht willkommen. \nDie Gründe hierfür sind folgende:\n- es gibt keine Wagen für Babyschalen oder für Kleinkinder. Man muss also die Babyschale in einen großen Wagen stellen. Damit ist der Wagen dann aber auch voll und man kann nicht mehr einkaufen. Zwei Wagen zu nutzen geht alleine nicht. \n- Auf Grund der Tatsache, dass alle Eltern extra Wagen für die Kinder nutzen und mit diesen im 1.OG rumfahren sind die schmalen Gänge voll und es gibt kein Durchkommen. Die Gangbreite an sich ist schon nicht komfortabel in meinen Augen.\n- Um mit dem Wagen in das 1.OG zu kommen muss man den Lift benutzen. Hiervon gibt es in dem ganzen Einrichtungshaus exakt einen (!). Man wartet demnach mit seinem Kind in der Reihe und versucht sich nicht von dem Gequengel der anderen anstecken zu lassen. Irgendwie DDR Feeling \nAußerdem war ich von der Weihnachtsdeko und Baumschmuck enttäuscht. \nZuletzt wäre dann auch noch die Freundlichkeit des Sicherheitsdienstes zu bemängeln  dieser trägt auch nicht zum zweiten Besuchsversuch bei. \nAlles in allem eine Enttäuschung für mich, da einfach zu anstrengend.

Ich blieb dann bei dem Cheeseburger mit Speck und Pommes hängen. Der war für 4,90EUR wirklich gut.

The second floor is home to several little boutique shops and the View Wine Bar and Kitchen.  My son and I decided to check it out after school one day since it's on the way home.  A nice open space that calls to mind an arty New York loft, Taste has two pinball machines, a pool table, and a Ms PacMan machine, a plus if there ever was one in my book. Customers have the option to build their own sandwich or salad. The teen chose a chicken sandwich on sourdough. I kept it light with a bowl of tomato bisque and a side of mac n cheese.  The sandwich and the tomato soup came out fairly quickly, but I ended up waiting another 20 minutes for the mac n cheese.  Apparently, hot food items are prepared by the View Kitchen upstairs.  After the first ten minutes, our waitress apologized for the wait and said that the kitchen had gotten backed up with orders.  We were the only customers downstairs in Taste, so I assumed the View upstairs was swamped.  After another ten minutes of waiting for a side dish and another apology from the waitress, I was ready to leave.  My son had finished his sandwich and the tomato soup was long gone, so when the food finally arrived, I was underwhelmed by the place, Ms PacMan or not.  The mac n cheese was actually good, made with wheat pasta; my son proceeded to eat half of it, so that's a good sign.  Considering we were the only customers in the place on a Friday at 2:00pm, I'd expect better service from a new place like this.  We may be back, but probably just to play Ms. PacMan."]}

I knew, from this event, that I was going to be eating much more of this healthy \u0026 delicious food.\n\nI have promised myself that I will order something different, next time I make it to the Campus Commons food court, but the Spicy Apricot Quinoa calls to me.  I already miss it; like an old friend.  It is a blend of spice, sweet, light aromatics, and properly cooked quinoa.  I once said,\"I could have eaten buckets.\"  As of now, I think I have!\n\nThe Zucchini Lasagna (w/ red wine marinara) was such a great take on traditional lasagna, I didn't even miss the pasta. The cheese, veggies (zucchini, roasted red peppers, spinach, \u0026 mushrooms), and sauce were done so well with nothing being over-powering.  I may try it again with meat sauce, but I am not sure, because it seems self-defeating in a veggie dish.\n\nThe newest item I tried was the  Chicken Chimichurri Wrap.  Very straight forward and tasty.  The sauce is a mixture of a spicy red sauce \u0026 chimichurri.  Fair warning to those sensitive to heat: this item is fairlyy hot (5/6 out of 10 on my random heat scale).  Though I liked it and it was tasty, it was a 3 ingredient dish, chicken, wrap, \u0026 sauce.  It was served with a few little, whole pickles on the side.  I think the flavor of the pickles actually masked the flavor of the wrap, so I didn't eat them all.\n\nLastly, the loaded oatmeal cookie and loaded it is! Chocolate, cherries, coconut, \u0026 seeds fortify the standard oatmeal.  There's lots going on in this cookie and one of the best cookies I have had lately.\n\nThe speed of food isn't supremely quick, but I don't have a problem because of the high food quality.  My last order took nearly 10 minutes; the chicken wrap \u0026 quinoa.  Prices are reasonable, but not exactly cheap.  For me, the bottom line is flavor \u0026 the healthiness of the food.

It was so juicy and tender. It wasn't hard to chew. And it was exceptionally flavorful! It was very delicious! The onion rings were perfect as well. It wasn't disgustingly oily or anything.

The buffet is large and had many items, lots of sushi and tons of fried and sauteed food.\n\nThe difference is in the taste:\nThe bad:\n- sushi was old and very cold, like it came out of a super cold fridge\n- Food did not look fresh when I got there at the start of the service\n- They had a roast beef that I think I had to cut myself, but one of the servers did it for me after I asked if I had to do it myself or not, she was not pleased.\n- Roast beef was also almost raw and very fatty.\n- Noodle dishes were ok, looked old but still ok\n- Egg rolls are plain and fatty from oil\n- All the other dishes looked the same color and not appetizing.\n\nThe good:\n- Fast service\n- Nice atmosphere\n- Took AMEX \n\nPlease, please, please, Fu Lam, please listen to your customers, you will not stay open for very much longer if this does not change.\n\nFull buffet came up to 24$ with tip (water, no drinks)"]}

You can get exactly what you want at that very moment right on your burger!  The only downside I can think of is that I brought my friend there to try it and he ordered a hotdog....","Before I get into the review, I just like to know why WEST Sunset Rd is simultaneously located to the EAST of E. Sunset Rd and also to the West!?  Who is the historical drunk and opium smoking individual or commission responsible for naming this road in Las Vegas, and why is this confusing anomaly allowed to persist?  Could it have contributed to the low test scores of Nevada education system and the general dismal geography knowledge of the Silver State?  \n\nThis is the burgers and hot dogs restaurant inside the updated local casino now called Wildfire Sunset.  The fact that the internal atmosphere inside the casino and thus Wildburger does not reek of aged cigarette is reason enough to bump it up a star.  Plus it looks clean, the staff does a good job clearing tables as guests leave after their meal, and even the plastic beverage cups look refreshingly new, all contribute to a positive guest impression.\n\nThey have a simple menu.  And is operated like a fast food restaurant, where you place and pay for your order, and wait a few minutes while the kitchen prepares your order.\n\nFor the late night and early morning crowd (11pm to 1pm) they offer their breakfast menu (Build Your Own Omelet, Bacon \u0026 Egg Platter, Pancakes, and their Wildburger Signature Breakfast Bowl).  $5-$8\n\nThey also serve hot dogs (Chili Dog, Giant Hot Dog and Giant Bacon Wrapped Dog).  $5-$7\n\nHowever, I will go out on the proverbial ledge and hypothesize that most are there for something from the burgers and sandwiches portion of the menu.  You can build your own or order one of the pre-conceptualized burger combo.  The cashier told me the most popular is their Classic Cheeseburger, but they also have The WIldburger (basically the Classic + their signature coleslaw), a Cajun Turkey Burger (if you don't like the red meat) or a Crispy Chicken Deluxe Sandwich.  $7 and up, depending on how many toppings and sauces you want on your order.\n\nThe Classic Cheeseburger was decent.  Loaded with veggies and 1/2lb Angus beef patty, and comes with a side of fries or onion strings.  The portion is large enough for all except amateur competitive eating contest hopefuls and beyond.\n\nChicken Wings and Boneless Wings with 9 flavor options.  $0.75 each when ordering 8pc, or $0.66 each when ordering 12pc or 15pc.\n\nTwo Salads selections, in case you are in the mood for some crisp fresh salads.\n\nDesserts selections are limited to Deep Fried Twinkies and their Made From Scratch Ding Dongs.  I tried the DF Twinkies mainly to see what it taste it, and can officially cross it off my bucket list.\n\nIt is a decent spot to grab a bite when you are keeping yourself entertained at this small local casino.  If you are in the area, by all means drop by, but with Wildburger locations distributed in various parts of Las Vegas, it is not reason enough to go out of your way to hit up this spot.\n\nSummary:  Inexpensive food that is decent, served in a clean and pleasant environment by friendly \u0026 helpful staff.\n\n3 + 1 stars!\n\n(This review is subsidized by Groupon Featured Deal)"]}

Ich empfehle den Salat Oktave; mit Auberginenpaste und Weinblätter.","Wer in die Oktave kommt merkt schnell, dass der Laden irgendwie anders ist. Das liegt zum einen an der sehr speziellen Einrichtung, die dem ganzen einen gewissen Charme verleiht, ohne Schicki-Miki zu wirken, und zum anderen auch am Personal. Hier geht alles sehr entspannt zu. Das gilt für beide Seiten. Man kann hier tatsächlich noch mit leeren Gläsern so lange sitzen wie man will, ohne dass man rausgenötigt wird.\nBesonders hervorzuheben ist das Essen. Es ist nicht von der Stange sondern lebt. Es schmeckt immer alles anders als beim letzten mal und anders als man es erwarten würde, aber immer total lecker. Das Essen wird daher nie langweilig, auch wenn man wie wir schon oft da war. Die Stärke der Oktave liegt definitiv in den Gewürzen und im Gemüse. Rein dem Geschmack nach zu urteilen, wird hier so gut wie kein Salz verwendet, der Geschmack kommt hauptsächlich aus den gefühlt tausend Gewürzen, Kräutern, Ingwer Daher schmeckt das Essen sehr abwechslungsreich, frisch und immer speziell nach Oktave. Wer allerdings nicht gerne scharfes Essen mag, sollte vorher fragen, ob das Essen der Wahl heute scharf ist (ingwer/chili). Das Gemüse kriegt man nirgends so bissfest wie hier. Es ist immer alles schön knackig statt matschig wie sonst oft. Der Salat ist sehr balsamicolastig, was einfach geschmackssache ist, wir finden ihn wirklich super lecker. Besonders empfehlenswert mit Maultaschen, die (dem Anschein nach) selbst gemacht sind.\nPersönlicher Tipp: Der Zenzela (Weißwein) und Baklava mit Vanilleeis, wobei letzteres aus mir unbekannten Gründen nicht in der Karte steht, aber trotzdem meistens da ist."]}

Qualitativ bleibt festzuhalten. der Belag war üppig und meiner Erwartung entsprechend. Der Pizzaboden leider nicht so ganz. Er war nur 3/4 fertig. Man hatte sich also sehr beeilt meine Bestellung so schnell als möglich fertig zu machen. Schade da hätte ich gerne noch 5 Minuten länger gewartet. \nFazit: Wenn die Bestellung termingerecht in der Pizzeria aufgenommen worden wäre glaube ich hätte das echt gepasst. Dann wäre die Pizza eben erst nach 40 Minuten eingetrudelt, der Boden wäre ganz fertig gewesen und mir hätte es auch geschmeckt.\nAber hätte, wäre und wenn ist eben nicht das Bewertungskriterium.\nSo bleiben mir nur zwei Punkte zu vergeben, denn es war eindeutig zu spät nicht so schmackhaft wie es hätte sein können. Drei Punkte wären drin gewesen, wenn man mir gesagt hätte, wir habens verschwitzt und der Boden wäre durch gewesen."]}

Nach unserem persönlichen\nEindruck, den wir hier widergeben, war es die mit Abstand schlechteste\nGaststätte, die wir jemals besuchten, und das waren schon viele. Leser mit\nstabilem Magen können jetzt weiterlesen. Wir suchten uns ein Plätzchen im\nGarten, der sich uns als sehr ungepflegt vorkam. Neben unserem Tisch standen\ntraurige Kübelpflanzen mit blattfreien Ästen aber einer Menge Unkraut. Kein\nProblem, der nächste Pflanzkübel strotzte nur so vor Leben, übersät mit\nBlattläusen aller Art. Für uns bis dahin kein Grund zum Ärgern sondern nur zum\nWundern. Wir bekamen von der Bedienung fix die Speisekarten gereicht, die nicht\nnur zerknittert waren sondern auch schon einige Flecken aufwiesen. So etwas\nlegt man Gästen nicht auf den Tisch. Immerhin konnte keiner etwas für den\nspontanen Vogelkot, der neben der vertrockneten Tischrose vom Himmel fiel.\nNaja, weiter gehts. Vor dem Essen wäscht man sich die Hände  wir hätten es\nbesser sein gelassen. Die Papierhandtücher waren leer, also bedient sich der\nfindige Gast eben beim Toilettenpapier. Die ungepflegte Schüssel (Haare auf der\nToilettenbrille) schmälerte den Appetit nun doch ein wenig. Die Getränke kamen\nschnell, beim Bitter Lemon war kunstvoll der Eichstrich auf den Millimeter\ngetroffen, beim Ginger Ale gab es deutlich Luft nach unten. Die Bedienung\nkonnte mit der Bezeichnung der Getränke nur wenig anfangen und fragte nach den\nentsprechenden Nummern in der Speisekarte  man ist ja gerne behilflich.\nAufgrund mannigfaltiger Erlebnisse in so kurzer Zeit vergingen die ca. 15\nMinuten bis zum Essen wie im Flug. Gereicht wurde eine vegetarische Platte mit\ngelben Linsen, bei denen wir uns nicht sicher waren, ob sie so säuerlich schmecken\nsollten oder ob die Qualität des Lebensmittels etwas gelitten hatte. Der\nBlattsalat mit Tomate war warm, was an der räumlichen Nähe zu den Linsen lag,\ndie auf dem gleichen Teller serviert wurden. Dazu gab es geschnittene\nKartoffeln und Karotten, die in einer Brühe schwammen und nach unserer Ansicht\nvöllig verkocht waren. Alles was ich bislang aufgezählt habe, lag übrigens einträchtig\ngemeinsam auf derselben Platte. Das Fladenbrot, das nach unserem Eindruck etwas\nmuffig schmeckte, nahmen wir zur Kenntnis. Naja, vielleicht isst man das alles so,\nunseren Geschmack traf es nicht. Der Bulgur war prima, da konnte man nichts\nfalsch machen. Jeder Kritikpunkt für sich wäre eine unwesentliche\nBegleiterscheinung, in der geballten Masse für uns jedoch eine Zumutung. Der eine Stern ist systembedingt zu vergeben, 0 Sterne fänden wir angemessen. Wir\nergriffen die Flucht und genossen woanders unser Abendessen."]}

We started with deep-fried softshell crab and a mixed salad (featuring dried cranberries, walnuts, and blue cheese). For mains (which we both particularly enjoyed) it was pan fried sea bass and rump of lamb. Dessert was a dark chocolate tartlet and something called \"munch\" (which turned out to be many little tasty desserty things on a plate). \n\nMany items on the menu can be ordered as either main or starter portions, which I thought was a lovely idea. I ended up having 2 starter-sized portions (for both courses), and it was more than enough to fill me up.\n\nOh, and they have a lot of cocktails. The cocktails, which are well-done classics for the most part, are about average-priced for the city. I've tried several, and I think the raspberry mojito is my favorite so far. \n\nService was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, if a tad slow at times. \n\nDisappointments: \n1) None of the vegetarian mains looked particularly exciting (though to be fair, I haven't tried them - perhaps they are absolutely thrilling to eat).\n2) No local beers on tap. Would love to see these added someday - I could definitely see us spending a sunny afternoon at one of their outdoor tables on the Royal Mile sipping beer and people-watching.","I visited Itchycoo this afternoon with the lovely Julie G and we had a lovely afternoon, so much so that we stayed and chatted in the lounge for several hours whilst savouring our afternoon tea and cocktails. I love the tradition of afternoon tea, and it is always fantastic to indulge in an afternoon of eating sandwiches, scones, and cakes. Itchycoo has taken the afternoon tea to a new level by letting you bypass the actual tea (or coffee) and skipping directly on to the cocktails. This is a fantastic idea (hey, if you're going for a decadent afternoon filled with cake, why not go all the way and get a cocktail, too!). \n\nItchycoo's cocktail list was lovely, and I couldn't decide between the Death by Chocolate or the Espresso Martini. The waiter helped me decide on the Death by Chocolate cocktail - it was fabulous, rich and decadent and definitely fit what I was looking for!\n\nAfter the cocktails arrived, our cake tower was paraded out to us. It was a beautiful array and selection. I think it's a general feature that the sandwiches at an afternoon tea are usually a let-down. The vegetarian versions we had were fine, but nothing stood out. We then moved on to the scone tier. The scones were tasty, but could have been a bit more fluffy and fresh. Itchycoo did very well with the cakes, though, which are always meant to steal the show anyway (let's face it). We had a banoffee pie, a fruit pie, meringues and carrot cake. I liked them in that order, too, with the meringues and the carrot cake both being fabulous. I was a tad disappointed that there was nothing chocolate included in the cake range, but then again my Death by Chocolate cocktail helped make up for that!\n\nWe really enjoyed sitting by the lovely windows in the lounge rather than in the dark bar area. However,  since we opted to sit farther away from the bar we were a bit neglected by service and had to ask three times for some tap water. However, that could have been because of the location we chose. Still, I wasn't thrilled in the service because I had originally made the reservation for 3pm but then tried to move it later to 4pm but was told that they were completely booked out for afternoon that afternoon so weren't able to let us come later. This was disappointing, especially because the whole time we were there it was extremely quiet with plenty of space at other tables, so they easily could have accommodated us an hour later. The online service was excellent, though, because the Radisson Bleu Edinburgh's social media people are really on it and were excited to have us come (as they should be!)."]}

Beautiful lasagne, colourful and flavoury salads (shut up, flavoury is totally a word) and a chap playing such soul drenchingly gorgeous jazz piano that I had to stop eating on three separate occasions because it took away my ability to do anything but sit and attempt to breathe.\n\nThe lasagne, being (naturally) vegetarian, was almost more like a moussaka, and so delicious that I wanted about eight of them. I suddenly understood why the chap I ordered from had repeated my order back to me as \"one lasagne?\" But any more, along with the two included salads, might have destroyed me, particularly as I planned to sample one of the exquisite looking cakes, for which I barely had room after those delicious lasagnery salady exploits. I reckon five star lasagne with a choice of two out of nine salads for just £7.50 is a damn good deal.\n\nI then, as planned, proceeded to the cakery. The cakes aren't labelled, so I asked the girl what each cake was and she had fun matching the names on a list to what they looked like. I opted for the chocolate and lemon, topped with physalis, because it looked dinky compared to the others. Ha - WRONG! It was dinky in size only, but denser than a singularity and rich, rich, rich. A little dry by nature, it was served with a whole glass dish of lemon curd for my ladling pleasure. Ogh. I think I shall never move again, my friends.\n\nDark wood tables, a sofa at the far end, stone vault ceilings...

As a touch they speak to you after your food just simply small talk but I guess they treat you like a human not just a contribution to a pay check at the end of the month.","I haven't visited Pizza Hut in years, but today we had a hangover emergency with the SR, so popped in while shopping at Kinnaird Park. It wasn't a great experience but almost the opposite of pizza establishments (irrespective of being higher end, independent or another chain). This particular restaurant was absolutely heaving on a chilly Sunday November afternoon. Our poor waitress looked like she was on the brink of a breakdown (and looking forward to her break, I don't blame her!). \n\nWe went for a massive pizza splurge, and I had the veggie/hot veggie half n half, while the SR had the BBQ Americano/Cajun Sizzler. My veggie was missing spinach entirely, and there was only a suggestion of a tomato sauce on the base. Oddly, despite there being a strong presence of the other vegetables (peppers, mushroom etc) the pizza mainly tasted of slighly undercooked pizza base. The SR commented that his was the same. \n\nIt's strange really, as I usually find pizzas tend to be stinting on toppings, that here, although the toppings were generous, overall, they were disappointing, and I think it was a combination of barely cooked pizza (perhaps the ovens were overworked due to the high turnover of people?) and stingy amount of tomato sauce dressing. \n\nService wise was not bad, given how busy it was, and we were tucked firmly in the furthest corner by the disabled toilets and the ice cream machine, our waitiress was doing her best. Cleanliness was a little suspect - after having to return two dirty cups (and questioned as to whether I was confusing tea stains for food stains... but tea stains don't leave congealed lumps... at least not the brands I use), I don't think I'll bother returning to a Pizza Hut again in the future."]}

Umso öfter fahre ich nach Bocholt zum Shoppen oder zum Kunden, nur um anschließend im Subway ein frisches, leckeres Sandwich zu essen. Wem das Subway-Sandwich-Konzept noch nicht geläufig ist, hier eine kleine Einführung:\nZuerst wählt man zwischen 5 leckeren Brotsorten und ob das Sandwich 15cm für den kleinen Hunger oder 30cm für den grossen Hunger, bzw. 2 Personen haben muss. Anschließend entscheidet man ob's mit Fleisch oder lieber vegetarisch werden soll. Wenn man sich für ein Sandwich mit Fleisch entschieden hat, bleibt einem die Qual der Wahl, da über ein dutzend Sorten zur Auswahl stehen. Hat man sich entschieden, kann man sich noch eine doppelte Portion Käse drauflegen lassen. Das Ganze wird dann (je nach Sandwich) kurz (30 Sec) gebacken. Nun gehts ans Gesunde ;o) Es stehen zur Auswahl:\nSalat, Tomaten, Oliven, Salatgurken, Eingelegte Gurken, Paprika, Peperoni und Zwiebeln. Darüber kommt eine von 7 Soßen und nach Wunsch Pfeffer und Salz.\nDas Ganze wird von einem der stets freundlichen Mitarbeiter FRISCH (!!!) zubereitet. Dabei wird auch sehr auf Hygiene geachtet. (Die Arbeitsflächen werden regelmäßig abgewischt, alle Mitarbeiter tragen Einweghandschuhe, die meist bei jedem Sandwich gewechselt werden, etc). Dazu kann man, wenn man möchte noch ein Getränk (welches man selbst nachfüllen darf) und einen Snack nehmen.\nMein Lieblingssandwich ist folgendes: Italian Brot mit Chicken Teriyaki, doppelt Käse, Salat, Zwiebeln, Paprika, eingelegte Gurken, dazu die Sweet Onion-Soße und Pfeffer / Salz. Einfach lecker.\n\n\n Hinterm Subway sind ca 15 Parkplätze, die man Kostenfrei nutzen kann. Das Restaurant ansich ist geräumig (geschätze 50 Sitzplätze) und klimatisiert, was vor allem in der heissen Jahreszeit zu einem kühlen Snack einlädt.

Served on two \"doubled up\" soft corn tortillas, with melted cheese, lettuce, avocado, and delicious lightly seasoned grilled ono, these were outstanding.  My only regret is that I did not get the triple instead of wimping out and getting the double.  The tacos came with rice and beans but I hardly noticed because the tacos were all I cared about.\n\nI'm still in shock 24 hours later.","When I was in Las Vegas two weeks ago, on my way home, I caught an early Hawaiian Airlines flight. \nRushing out of my hotel, \u0026 returning the rental car, I did not have anytime to eat anything in the wee morning hours........\n\nLucky for me, the McCarran Airport's new Terminal 3 has a whole bunch of places to eat \u0026 shop,.........they even have slot machines, so you can do some last minute gambling! Lol!!!\n\nAfter checking in at Hawaiian Airlines, passing the TSA screening area, catching the monorail to Terminal 3.........it was time to sit down, relax, \u0026 get something to eat before I board my flight home.\n\nAfter walking around Terminal 3, I found this place called Baja Fresh \"Express\" Mexican Grill. It was a good place I could grab something quick..........food was edible, but of course nothing like I would get at a restaurant. But the convenience factor was spot on!\n\nOrdered myself - two Breakfast Burrito's \u0026 two soda's.............aaaah, breakfast of Champions!!!! All of this for just under $20 bucks. Not bad to airport food........as you know, the prices will be a little higher at the airport due to the convenience factor, and probably the vendor's high rent, \u0026 taxes.\n\nThe food......well, the breakfast burrito was quite BIG, it was loaded with eggs, potatoes, \u0026 one type of meat. I ended up taking bacon for my meat. Everything about the breakfast burrito was okay, with the exception of the bacon which was kinda soggy \u0026 rubbery. If they had cooked the bacon to a crisp, then loaded it in the burrito, I'm sure it would have tasted a little better......but what do you expect for airport food???? \nIt's all about convenience folks!"]}

The smallest amount of wings is 15 which is fine, but only giving one small container of ranch isn't enough. Make sure you ask for 2-3. \n\nThe French fries are not good.

I ordered wings with hot sauce and the sauce had a very good buttery taste to it but not hot at all.  Suicide sauce was not listed as a option.  I ordered fries too, they're fresh made peel-on fries that had a good taste to them but under cooked.  The kitchen is open to the lobby and anyone with restaurant experience can tell that these guys are still learning how to run a kitchen.  They told me that they've been open for three weeks so far.  So with time I hope these guys become a well oiled machine!  Two of the three people working continually checked on us.  To this point I was not giving this place the rating I gave them or considering returning either.  What won me over about this place was the young lady behind the counter who I believe might be the owner came by to talk to us after the meal.  She truly wanted feedback on our experience which really shows she cares and wants to improve.  I brought up the \"hot\" sauce and was told that I should have told them to make the wings spicy.  If you offer a hot sauce it should have a bite to it without telling them I REALLY want hot sauce.  I'm not the normal consumer, I love extremely spicy food and these wings where weak so maybe a suicide sauce should be available without scaring away the 95% who does not want spicy to my liking.  My wife mentioned the soggy fries and was told that they are trying to figure out the fries and sauces. \n\nI will return and hope that they figure things out.  They by far are concerned of your experience so know that they'll get the menu down.  These guys should be given a chance to succeed!"]}

Food was ok; definitely not best in Montreal as some claim on Facebook. \n\n2. The AYCE Monday is misleading as it only applies to rolls (which you don't find out till you're at the restaurant), but some tempura are included. No soup, salad, desserts (this would have been fine had it not been for the steep price of $35/person. Not even edamame was included). Rolls with raw fish barely had any fish in the middle. It was mainly rice. Manager should work on advertising clearly and providing a separate menu for AYCE instead of having the server point out what is and what is not included. It confuses everyone, including a new server. \n\n3. Shrimp and any shellfish is imitated as the actual animal is not considered kosher. (I suggest not even having them rather than having imitated meats). Even though fish is considered kosher, they do not have unagi on the menu. \n\n4. (This and #5 were most bothersome). We were a party of 3 and we wanted to try AYCE, but server told my S-I-L that because she's only having 2 rolls, then she should just pay for the 2 and not pay $35. We tried to explain we're all sharing and she said that was fine. When we received the bill, we were all charged $35. It would have been fine had she just corrected herself during the meal rather than surprising us at the end.\n\n5. We asked to pay separately and she said ok and let us know that $6 tip was automatically added to each of our bill (at the end, it was $6.15)....wait...we're only a party of 3 and we should be allowed to leave as much as we'd like. Also I'm not sure how she calculated her tips, but if it's 15%, there's a bit of an issue...I know a lot of people seem to be confused about this, but tips are calculated BEFORE taxes...not AFTER. I don't mean to sound petty, but I was not happy with the service in the first place and was originally going to tip just shy of 15% before taxes anyway.\n\nWe were just so shocked and didn't feel like arguing about the service and charges; we just wanted to leave. I can boldly say I've never felt so cheated and unsatisfied as I did this evening. We will never return here or recommend this place to anyone. It's sad that the first review for this place is so low, but I feel it's necessary. \n\nI am not seeking compensation, but hope management will change for the better after reviewing this."]}

Most places around town I have tried it, I have not returned, call me picky I suppose. You can smell the smoke when you park your car. The place has been given a much needed facelift, it is clean, has a non-smoking seating area, has 3 different service bar areas, big screen tvs, a stage for planned DJs, bands and karaoke and an open kitchen. I saw a wood pile that they use to fuel the grill for burgers, etc. An extensive menu offers lots of options for meat, seafood and sides, we had the chance to try a little bit of a lot of things. I did have a chance to talk to the owner and learned the pulled pork alone goes through a 12 hour process to go from raw pork, to what is on my plate. He is also a former USDA inspector which is comforting when running a kitchen and dealing with raw product in food service.\n\nMeat Party:\nThe sliced brisket is tender, a little fat cap left on for moistness, dry rubbed spices, yum! Pulled pork is juicy and has a well balanced flavor, it is not served over-sauced, the way I prefer. They have wet brisket, chopped brisket sauced up, used on sandwiches, loaded fries and nachos. The smoked grilled wings, OMG something different in town, really a MUST try! Big on flavor, deep layers of smoke topped by a flame kissed skin. You can get them with any sauce, we got the 'signature' which is pleasantly perfect. Some sauces can be too sweet or too spicy, or even grainy, this was none of those, it was remarkably unremarkable (a good thing). It lets the meat shine through which a true BBQ lover can appreciate. They have both baby back and St Louis ribs, each has a nice bark on them and fall right off the bone on command. Also on the menu was honey glazed chicken, it is a top seller and I will try it on my next go-round.\n\nWe also sampled the southern fried chicken, such a light coating of batter but big on flavor, tastes like it had been marinating in seasoned batter for sure! The fried shrimp also have a delicate tempura like batter and are large in size. We had them as sliders, on Cellone's mini buns with shredded lettuce and a sriracha mayo. These were also one of my favorites of the night, unexpectedly. I went for BBQ, and came out in love with shrimp and pickles (BBQ included) PS- Get the fried pickles, just do it.\n\nSides:\nThey have everything a southern menu should or could have. My personal favorite was the house made cornbread. Hearty and sweet, didn't fall apart and was even better the next day as breakfast! Fresh cut fries and house fried tortilla chips as well. Next time will have to try the biscuits, greens, black eyed peas, mashed potatoes and the rest. The owner says they smoke their own bacon and hocks to flavor the sides with - most ingredients are made from scratch, he focuses on freshness and knowing where food comes from.\n\nI like knowing where my food comes from, maybe not the name of the pig, or what farm it came from, but knowing it was made with pride and so are all it's friends. I left with a smile on my face, sauce on my forehead, smoke on my fingers and an appointment at the gym for tomorrow. I give The Smokehouse Bar \u0026 Grill a high five."]}

I was surprised at the lack of signs for it on the Royal Mile, but I quite liked the way it was tucked away. Like I mentioned, these restaurants always have some sort of offer on, so in we went, armed with our '50% off' voucher.\n\nThe place was lovely inside, and staff were very friendly as we entered. The menu was much the same as any Zizzi's restaurant, filled with pizzas, pastas, calzones, risottos and a few meat and fish dishes. We started with delicious mozarella garlic bread- this had got to be the BEST garlic bread ever. I big wooden platter, laden with melty, gooey, caramelised oniony, garlicky goodness! The portion is super huge so could do for 2 people (probably more, but hey, once you've tasted it you'll not want to share too much!) We also got some delicious calamari with a lemony mayo. \n\nThe mains were great too, I was there with my family and we got a whole mixture of pizzas and pastas. They do lovely thin rustica pizzas and my mum had something called a spiedini which was a sort of hanging skewer with prawns, salmon, sea bream, pepper and courgettes. At the end of the meal my Gran told us it was 'the best pasta she had ever eaten' so they were doing something right! We finished off with some gelato to share, and it was lovely (if a little small.)\n\nThe restaurant has a lovely view out across Princes Street and the Balmoral and we saw some Edinburgh trams passing by. With it being a large chain you sort of know what to expect with Zizzi's and it's not maybe the most exciting place to eat. Saying that, they have some great offers and the food is tasty.

We took them out for a stroll and settled at Con U to eat, but just a FYI: they come as I show in the picture, there's no real take-out package option. \n\nThey have other 50 types of crepes (I'm sure you can customize them too) as well as smoothies and a few other things - I was starving so I was too busy eying my crepe in my hand to check out much else. Only a few seats but in this gorgeous weather, you can easily eat it as you take a stroll if it's busy."]}

Raising Cane's have been popping up around the valley and since I'm a sucker for chicken fingers, I decided to try them out. The menu is simple: chicken fingers, fries, Texas toast and coleslaw (and a chicken finger sandwich.) I got \"The Box\" which included, 4 fingers, Canes sauce, fries, Texas toast, cole slaw and drink. When I got home and opened the lid, I immediately noticed the fingers were much much smaller than anticipated (about 3-4\" long) The fingers  lacked flavor, were dry, and had way too much breading. The \"canes sauce\" had flavor, but very salty. The Texas toast- well it was just a thick piece of bread, nothing special.  So next time I have a craving for chicken fingers, I will go to my old stand by: Culvers!","My son is a fan of Cane's and that is where we found about this place. \nIf you want chicken this is a place you can get chicken fingers. I know most think of chicken fingers as ground up chicken molded to look like a bar. Here is is white meat chicken pulled put if batter and fried. \nChicken is the only thing you can get beside the sides that are available. \nThere is a secret menu. I don't know how extensive it may be but I know if you don't want the batter on the chicken you can order it \"naked\". Since I am on a no carb diet that is how i eat it. \nHave been there two times and will go back when I am in the area."]}

The 44th Street and Camelback area has become loaded with new places, all of which are great, but if you want a QUIET and very pretty sit down spot, go to Taylors Place.","I've been going to Taylor's Place for breakfast/brunch since it was Taylor's Cafe back in 2009. Every time I've gone the meal has been absolutely wonderful, and I would have given it 5 stars every time.  However, taking my mother here today as part of her Christmas present to the Nutcracker Suite Ballet was quite the letdown. I deliberately showed up two hours before the show to account for a busy Sunday brunch. \n\nMy mother and I arrived and there was no one sitting outside, and inside there were 2 empty tables in the main area. When we sat down our waiter (yes I still use the old term) asked us what beverages we wanted, and we were served rather quickly. He asked if we wanted a few more minutes before placing our order and we agreed... He didn't show up for ten minutes. \n\nAfter we placed our order, my mother and I sat and talked. When I looked at the time, a half an hour had passed and we now had an hour and 15 minutes before the curtain. It was already going to take 15 minutes to drive there. My mother and I looked around and now the restaurant was less than half full. We called over the bus boy (yes I still use the old terms), and asked him to find out about our breakfast. He left and I waited to see where my waiter was. \n\nWhen the waiter appeared with no plates I'd had enough. I got up, which got his attention and told him my mother and I had been waiting for half an hour for our breakfast and the restaurant wasn't even busy. I told him my mother and I are on a schedule, told him I'd pay for our beverages ww no longer had time to wait for our breakfast. His answer? \"We'll have them cancel your order, don't worry about the beverages.\" All I could think was,  \"Cancel? Did you even bother to put in the order?\" I must say Taylor's service has never been like this. I am greatly disappointed."]}
